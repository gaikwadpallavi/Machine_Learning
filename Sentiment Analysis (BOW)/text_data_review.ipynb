Adam and Barbara Maitland (Alec Baldwin and Geena Davis) discover many of the conflicting rather human imperfections that haunt the lives of the living also plague the afterlife as well.<p>Unlike some film projects that seemed to be blindly assigned to dispassionate filmmakers for commercial reasons, Beetlejuice's plot and bizarre subject matter remarkably complemented Burton's unusually macabre artistic sensibilities extraordinarily well. Created by the unbelievably brilliant guidance of imaginative film director, Tim Burton (Pee Wee's Big Adventure, Batman, Ed Wood, Sleepy Hollow). The film's uniquely creative landscape was a culmination of essentially all of the abundant irony and outlandish yet human behaviors that have graced the body of Burton's work.<p>Augmented by deviously energetic performances from Glenn Shadix, Jeffrey Jones, Winona Ryder, Catherine O' Hara, Geena Davis, and Alec Baldwin, the film bustles with uninhibited brilliant hilarity that persistently pushes the film to a level of almost affable euphoria. Paired with its ingenious screenplay and a tour de force performance by Michael Keaton as Beetlejuice. This film transforms itself into an exuberant jovial exercise that is extremely satisfying and philosophically perceptive on many levels. Though comedy is usually considered to be unable or undeserving of deep critical analysis, Beetlejuice is an undeniably inspired concept that has been flawlessly transferred to film. One of the most outstanding comedies of the 1980's. <p>As for the film's DVD package, the DVD includes the theatrical trailer, an isolated Danny Elfman musical track, and the choice to watch the film in anamorphic widescreen or Pan and Scan. Hopefully Beetlejuice will eventually be graced with a special edition. We can always hope.\\n\",\n",

It is one of the funiest movies ever made, mixing a strange reality to the story, along with a romance between Alec Baldwin and Geena Davis. The funny thing about this story is  the strange world between the living and the dead, and the recently deceased handbook, ha. You have to wait in your house for 125 years, while haunting the people that come in, and trying not to break your cover, and in the story, that is why hauntings take place.

Obviously it's wonderful to be able to open a bottle of wine and have it stay good for a day or two, especially if you just like one glass with dinner. This lets you open up and enjoy more expensive wine since you won't waste the whole rest of the bottle. If you are interested in learning about wines, you'll probably want to open up 2 or more wines at a time to compare them, and this way you won't waste anything. The wine saver will keep the undrunk portion until the next time.  I do recommend putting the bottle in the fridge if you don't drink it the next day. Just pull the bottle out an hour before you want to drink it if it's red.\\n\",\n",

Prior to buying VacuVin, my red wine bottles would last a maximum of 1-2 days if immediately re-corked, and white wine a few days longer if refrigerated.  Now, my red wine is good for up to a week, and the white wine lasts even longer.  The device is very simple - it pumps air through a plastic cork to re-create the original pressure prior to opening.  Simple to use, and the corks are easy to rinse.  Perfect for single people like me who don't want to drink a full bottle in one sitting, or who may switch from red one night to white the next.\\n\",\n",
              " \"I've been using Vacu Vin's previous model for years and have been happy with it.  The one downside of the earlier offering was that wine lovers never knew when a vacuum was achieved.  I used to overpump just to make sure the wine-damaging oxygen was out of the bottle.<p>I got this model in Napa a few months ago and I'm glad I did.  While it doesn't deliver on its Concerto promise, it does give you reassuring clicks when a vacuum has been reached, enabling you to stop pumping sooner.  It's a nice refinement.<p>The only downside over the previous model is that it won't work with the marinating device sold separately because the bottom is configured differently from the earlier model.\\n\",\n",

And the hues are beautiful and distinctive. The black and red, two colors which are very difficult to get when dying frostings, etc. are especially nice - probably the best of any manufacturer I have tried.<p>For those who had questions, I am not 100% certain about the sizes, but if the set is the same as mine, the bottles are 3/4 ounce. While that might not seem like much, all you need is a dot of this thick gel paste at the end of a toothpick to color large amounts of material. So there is plenty of coloring ability in each bottle - many, many times more than a same sized liquid food color bottle. <p>Highly recommended and at a really good price at the time of this review.\\n',\n",

They\\'re simply possessed by friendly demons with a spiritual intent to entertain and cause wonder. <p>Each album collectively draws numerous inspirations and styles, completely entertaining the listener through lyrics and musicianship on a variety of traditional and obscure instruments.

For two decades now, I\\'ve held a relentless belief that CVB would make the most amusing backyard-party band -- sure to make Granmma Nelly dance alongside her pierced third generation of family one moment and then cover her bleeding ears when the next song begins.  However, I believe the band\\'s intent is not to frighten or shock, but to instead expose the wealth of musical styles that one listener despises while another reaches a glee plateau.  Be sure that these same two listeners will switch positions when a later tune begins.  Are you prepared to enjoy the best of many worlds?<p>Picturesque landscapes are lyrically drawn with a slacker-like intelligence in unimportant poignancy, the next moment you are drawn into a global hoe-down, followed then by crafty psychedelica mixed with raw instrumentals, closing with an guitar orchestra jamout with lead played by a screaming violin chant.  Add a half-tablespoon of sugar Wiseguy and serve.  <p>Add this to your collection if you appreciate bands that are like no other.  Some tracks will prompt you to ask \"Why?\", yet with an immediate second thought you\\'ll smile and say \"Why hasn\\'t Anyone Else?\"<p>[I noticed that CVB had recently made a handful of live performances after a long time apart.  I\\'ve caught several of their shows and recommend all to give your mind a jolt of electricity that is surprisingly pleasant.

They\\'re simply possessed by friendly demons with a spiritual intent to entertain and cause wonder. <p>Each album collectively draws numerous inspirations and styles, completely entertaining the listener through lyrics and musicianship on a variety of traditional and obscure instruments.  One can only imagine the pure enjoyment the band had while first writing then performing these before an audience.  For two decades now, I\\'ve held a relentless belief that CVB would make the most amusing backyard-party band -- sure to make Granmma Nelly dance alongside her pierced third generation of family one moment and then cover her bleeding ears when the next song begins.  However, I believe the band\\'s intent is not to frighten or shock, but to instead expose the wealth of musical styles that one listener despises while another reaches a glee plateau.  Be sure that these same two listeners will switch positions when a later tune begins.  Are you prepared to enjoy the best of many worlds?<p>Picturesque landscapes are lyrically drawn with a slacker-like intelligence in unimportant poignancy, the next moment you are drawn into a global hoe-down, followed then by crafty psychedelica mixed with raw instrumentals, closing with an guitar orchestra jamout with lead played by a screaming violin chant.  Add a half-tablespoon of sugar Wiseguy and serve.  <p>Add this to your collection if you appreciate bands that are like no other.  Some tracks will prompt you to ask \"Why?\", yet with an immediate second thought you\\'ll smile and say \"Why hasn\\'t Anyone Else?\"<p>[I noticed that CVB had recently made a handful of live performances after a long time apart.  I\\'ve caught several of their shows and recommend all to give your mind a jolt of electricity that is surprisingly pleasant.  You will walk away wide-eyed at the unrealized potential and wasted energy we swallow in 99% of today\\'s music. ]\\n',\n",

              " \"Few things I'd like to point out:<p>1.  &quot;Espresso&quot; is not a roast.  It's a drink.  In northern Italy they make espresso from Vienna roast, in southern Italy they use French.  Starbucks appears to be using French roast, so they should just label it French roast like any normal person would.<p>2.  The product description says &quot;Taste Espresso Roast as both a shot of espresso and brewed in a coffee press. This is one versatile coffee!&quot;  This is patently absurd.  It's pre-ground coffee, and it's either for use in espresso machines or presses, but not both.  Here's why:<p>Making a shot of espresso requires a very fine grind.  Making coffee press coffee requires a very course grind.  If you have ground coffee that is appropriate for espresso machines, it will pass through the filter in a coffee press and you will have a cup of sludge.  If you use ground coffee that does not pass through a press's filter in an espresso machine, you do not get espresso.  You get cafe crema, which is a good, but entirely different, beverage.<p>Therefore, a &quot;Universal Grind&quot; is an impossibility.  They should tell you on the label what kind of coffee maker it's ground for, like normal people.<p>3.  It's over-roasted.  Starbucks has an excellent bean-sourcing operation that buys better coffee than any other company of its size.  Then they roast all their beans Vienna or French.  Most beans taste best at a particular level of roasting that varies with the bean, and for most beans that level is not Vienna or French.  So why roast all your beans too dark?  I guess it's just easier that way.  Also, it lets them rename Vienna Roast as &quot;Starbucks Roast&quot; because the Austrians don't seem to care.<p>That said, this is still better than what you get in the supermarket - Starbucks specializes in coffee and sources much better beans than any of the companies that also make cheese, hot dogs, shampoo or cigarettes.<p>Anyway, if you really want some good coffee, do this:<p>Buy a grinder.  Nothing makes coffee lose flavor like keeping it around after grinding.  If you have a drip coffee machine, get a grinder with spinning blades; if you have something else like a press or vacuum pot, get a grinder with burrs.  If you have an espresso machine, get a very nice grinder with burrs.  Amazon has good deals on all three kinds, just do a search for 'coffee grinder'.  It's not that much money, and if you're somebody who's willing to pay for Starbucks you should invest in one.<p>Find a local coffee shop that roasts their own coffee and gives you the date it's roasted on.  Freshness matters!  Good beans don't taste nearly as good after they've been sitting around.<p>Ask the people at your local shop to tell you about the correct amount of beans to use.  Most people don't use the right amount.  If you don't use enough, your coffee comes out bitter, especially if you have a drip machine.  Not enough coffee means the beans you do have get too much exposure to hot water, which makes bitter coffee.\\n\",\n",

As with most sugar free products they taste great if you have not been eating sugar, but taste a little off if you switch straight from eating full sugar/fat desserts.  The cake mixes only require water to make. A teaspoon of real vanilla or almond extract improves the flavor.  I like to make the chocolate cake with iced coffee.  Then rather than use sugar free frosting (ugggh!) I sprinkle the top with either unsweetened cocoa or with chopped coffee beans.  The bitterness of the cocoa and the coffee beans enhances the sweetness of the cake. These mixes make a very thin eight-inch layer.

I'm almost out of the bottles I bought (just opened 2 of them, and they're fresh as ever!) and was thrilled to see them available on Amazon!

              " \"Red beans and rice is such a simple dish.  Everybody in New Orleans eats it on Mondays, from cab drivers and port workers to businesspeople and Tulane kids.<p>New Orleaneans (native or adopted, displaced or otherwise) know that red beans and rice is a very subtle dish.  The beans at Dunbar's, Mother's, and Ye Olde College Inn (all famous for the dish) are all different, and everybody's mother has her own recipe, too.  There are many variables involved in getting it to come out just right, from the choice of meat to the number of bay leaves to add to the pot.  <p>The most important is in choosing beans.  Red beans and rice cooked by displaced New Orleaneans elsewhere doesn't always come out as creamy as people in the city are used to--often they're thick and starchy and the beans need to be put in a blender to get anything resembling the gravy in the authentic dish.  One reason for this is that Americans outside of New Orleans and the Deep South really don't eat beans, red or otherwise, and the beans sit on the shelf and toughen.  The second reason is that the &quot;red kidney bean&quot; popular in New Orleans is not the same thing as the kidney bean used in three-bean salad or Texas chili.  It's smaller, hence it cooks faster, gets creamier faster, and has a more intense color and flavor.<p>Camellia beans are authentic Louisiana red beans--the small variety--and they're probably the most popular in New Orleans.  They enjoy such a good reputation because they're almost invariably fresh and they produce the creamy pot of beans that, more than any other dish, reminds us of New Orleans.\\n\",\n",

This creates a magical apple cider experience with hints of cranberry and hibiscus flowers gathered in an ancient land.<br /><br />Snuggle Up Spiced Cider is a good choice because you can then spoon in the exact amount you desire, but packets of cider work equally well. This is the type of tea you would expect to enjoy after skiing in some distant forest where you are also munching on homemade brownies or eggnog cookies. Apple cider also works very well with the Gypsy Teas, especially the Lemon Jasmine.<br /><br />The deep purple/red color and hibiscus fragrance of Tazo Tea is enough to make anyone passionate about tea. Yet, is this really tea? It looks like tea, but it is really an herbal infusion made by steeping hibiscus flowers, orange peel, licorice, cinnamon, rose hips, lemongrass and red poppy in a swirling of hot water.<br /><br />The original flavor is also slightly reminiscent of hot apple cider or hot cranberry juice which is why it is extra delicious with a cider mix.

You can use a teapot or a coffee maker to make tea. Simply put the tea in a coffee filter or the tea bags in the coffee pot, then allow the boiling water to drip over the tea leaves.<br /><br />The sensual blend of exotic spices, teas and herbs used in their teas include a mixture of the following: Black tea, green tea, hibiscus flowers, chamomile flowers, lemongrass, spearmint leaves, blackberry leaves, cinnamon, Rooibos, Gingerroot, rose hips, orange peel, rose petals, licorice root, safflowers, black pepper, lemon verbena leaves, cardamom, cloves, peppermint leaves, chicory, sarsaparilla root, lemon balm leaf, star anise and red poppy flowers.<br /><br />This is a blend of black teas, but all their teas are worth trying.

This mocha was one-of-a-kind! I had to know what was in it. It was IBARRA!<p>Basically, Mexican chocolate is pure cocoa with cinnamon. IBARRA also adds some sugar and an emulsifier (which is why I only give it 4 stars). I have made mochas and hot chocolates at home and my guests think I'm a god (maybe an Aztec god!). It just really brings an orginal taste unlike any of those other cheap sugary brands (Nestle, Hershey's, ect.). <p>I highly recommend it. But two suggestions: IBARRA comes in &quot;bricks&quot; that you must chop or grind. We use a coffee bean grinder, but make sure it's a good quality grinder or cut the pieces into smaller pieces. Otherwise you might have a broken coffee bean grinder. For a real authentic feel you can use a stone and pistol just fine. And a recipe suggestion: Grind a portion of a Hazelnut for an added spice.

              " 'Organic Sucanat is many levels above regular white granulated sugar. This sugar takes baking and tea drinking to new levels of pleasure.<br /><br />When holding this sugar in the palm of your hand, you will notice the irregularity of the crystals and the  \"dark brown sugar\" color. This does have a flavor that is reminiscent of brown sugar and yet the texture is much more natural and the crystals take longer to melt on your tongue.<br /><br />Recently I\\'ve been discovering a variety of more natural sweeteners. This on is perfect for tea because it not only adds sweetness; it adds a caramel flavor to teas in which you use milk. There is a purity in the flavor and you feel better because you are supporting organic farms and keeping your body healthy.<br /><br />This is a one-for-one replacement for refined white or brown sugar.<br /><br />Sucanat is made from 100% certified organic sugar cane. The sugar cane is \"green cut.\" This means the fields are not burned and the leaves and tops of the cane plant are left in the field. The sugar is minimally processed and once the sugar cane is harvested it is pressed to squeeze out all the cane juice. This juice is then clarified, filtered and evaporated. This helps to remove excess water. The syrup is then crystallized and a sugar with a molasses flavor is produced. There are also vitamins, minerals and trace elements from the sugar cane plant. One teaspoon of Sucanat contains 10mg of Potassium and 6mg of Calcium.<br /><br />If you are still using white sugar, try Sucanat. It might surprise you with added flavor, goodness and purity. I find the flavor to be superior to refined white sugar. This sugar will add a touch of caramel flavor to all your baking.<br /><br />If you are looking for an even deeper flavor for chocolate recipes, try Muscovado sugar. It has a rich flavor that can\\'t be matched by any regular brown sugar you would find in your grocery store. With Muscovado and Sucanat, you can take your baking to the next level.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review\\n',\n",

The individual wrappings have a nice crinkly sound and the colors are all so soothing and quite beautiful. These teas are definitely for the aesthetically aware. Drinking Tazo teas literally becomes a magical experience. There is something mysterious going on here. The teas even seem to have a magical glint or luster to them.

It started with one or two people having colds, needing a tea, and all we happened to have on hand was the Tazo.  What a smart decision by our managers to purchase this product!  It caught on like nothing else had there!  Soon, we were serving more tea than beer!  <p>From a personal standpoint, however, I can attest to its flavor and qualities.  It is the best tea I have ever had the pleasure to drink myself.  The Zen flavor is no exception.  I would highly recommend that you try out all of them (or at least as many as you can) and decide on your own personal Tazo, as the myriad of blends can be a bit overwhelming.  Zen is probably the best green tea I have tried, though.  It's one of my personal favorites.<p>The price really is a bargain.  I've compared in grocery stores and you're better off buying the 6 count dispenser (144 bags in total).  Trust me, you will definitely drink that much tea.  During the summer months, it makes a truly unique and exceptionally tasty iced tea as well and in the winter with a little honey and lemon, it's a perfect suppressant of cold symptons (I would still claim there is no CURE for a cold yet).  Drink in good health and enjoy!\\n\",\n",

              " \"&quot;Hime&quot; is &quot;Princess Brand&quot; and it is a big seller in Japanese and Korean grocery stores. This faintly green powder is mixed with water to make a thick paste to get wasabi, used for sushi, sashimi and to flavor tuna and other dishes. <p>One trick is to mix the wasabi in a rice bowl or tea bowl and turn the bowl upside-down. Yes, that's what I said, turn it over. The paste will stick in the bowl, and the developing sulfurous gases that make wasabi hot, hot, hot are retained, improving the bite. Get that wasabi buzz. <p>I like to use it in tuna with wasabi-potato crust. Or being short on time, I just grill some yellowtail and mix a wasabi-sugar-soy sauce glaze and brush it on at the end of the grilling. Hot and sweet. Another totally bizarre but quite normal Japanese dish is wasabi nori chazuke, or tea-rice. Get some leftover rice warmed up in a bowl, put a dab of wasabi and a sprinkle of sushi nori strips. Pour hot green tea (bancha) over and drink like a soup. Said to be a cure for hangover (I wouldn't know, but they say it works.)\\n\",\n",

              " \"The flavor of cardamom is medicinal to some--well, it has been used for years to mask the bad taste of remedies. It is a resinous (piney) aromatic bitter-sweet spice, rather intense. The green papery pods are broken open, and the dark seeds inside can be pulled out and ground in a mortar for use in breads, cookies, curries, puddings, chai and the like. It is the spice of &quot;kheer&quot;--Indian rice pudding, where sometimes the whole green pods are thrown in. I use it in tea or even coffee, bruising the black seeds slightly with the pestle. It is also commonly used in pilau (pilaf) or biryani, that festive Indian rice and meat or vegetable cassarole. Scandinavian cooking uses this spice in many cookies and cakes. <p>If you aren't used to the flavor, it can be a bit startling--not sweet and spicey like cinnamon or nutmeg. The pods are a nuisance to process, but the volatile essential oils are so fugitive that it's better to put up with the job of extracting the seeds than to use ground cardamom that will just lose its scent. Rather like the difference between fresh grated nutmeg and powdered.\\n\",\n",

Of special interest to me was the fact that no refined white sugar is used to sweeten it (only molasses) and no white flour is used (only whole wheat and rye flours). This bread is therefore quite closer to a South Beach Diet-acceptable &quot;dessert&quot; versus something you'd get in a typical bakery (with the possible exception of the molasses...didn't read that far).<p>The raisins were sweet and delicious and the bread is rich and hearty. I paid $1.99 locally and found it to be a very good value. It was flavorful and delicious enough by itself that butter actually was a negative when I tried it! That doesn't happen often.<p>I would recommend you try this product at least once to see what you think.

              " \"Having received some Blue D'Auvergne along with several other artisan cheeses this Xmas, I was very pleased with the smoothness of this Blue. Unlike the more famous roquefort, D'Auvergne is slightly milder, with less of an after-flavor.  It does not overpower one's tastes and is a good choice for those looking for the strength of a french Bleu but wishing to avoid offending delicate palettes.  <p>This cheese is made from Sheep's Milk and contains the famed veins of blueish bacteria that give the cheese its signature flavor. This Blue was not wet nor sticky as many of the trendier Blues of late seem to have become. Neither has it the overly dry texture of say an English Blue Stilton, a traditional holiday Blue cheese on its own or in combination with the English Gloucster Cheddar and referred to as &quot;Huntsman&quot; cheese, whcih is very pretty, but suitable only as a dessert cheese or for afternoon Tea owing to its dryness.<p>Blue D'Auvergne, on the other hand, has a subtle creamy texture without being overly moist. Some Bleus err on the side of moistness now to the point of being more similar to a triple-creme.  Not so this Bleu. D'Auvergne slices well with the proper cutlery and can be crumbled if you'd like it that way.  It melted well atop a pear tart we made and complimented the sandy sweetness of the pears wtihout overpowering their delicate flavor &amp; scent as a Bleu such as Roquefort would have easily done.  This is a fine addition to the French Bleus and it was a pleasure to have on hand at a time when rich foods were bieng served and the D'Auvergne could be used to sprinkle atop a lightly seared Filet mignon with a sultana reduction sauce or tossed into a simple salad of dandilion greens, leftover crushed walnuts,and nasturtium vinegrette. The possibilities are endless.<p>This cheese was not too rich but was just rich enough to enhance any dish it graced. It's light tang was never overpowering, rather it added a gentle dash of excitment to the foods with which we paired it. Although there was none left over for a simpler dish, I would have loved to have tried it on its own either with wine or as part of a fruit plate.  I look forward to getting more of this fine cheese.\\n\",\n",

It is all natural and doesn\\'t contain any preservatives. You can use this flour for bread machine baking too and it produces superior results. I\\'ve used the recipe on the back of the bag and adapted it by using a mixture of whole wheat and regular bread flour because I didn\\'t have any \"gluten\" as called for in the recipe. If you substitute 1 ½ cups of regular bread flour for part of the whole wheat flour you don\\'t seem to need the gluten.<br /><br />Bob\\'s Red Mill products remind me of my childhood when my father took me to the Graue Mill in Oakbrook, IL where we watched corn being milled.

              " \"Tim Burton had come off the blockbuster success of his first feature film PEE-WEE'S BIG ADVENTURE (1985) when he was greenlighted by Warner Bros. to direct the project he REALLY wanted to make. It was the picture that would define the rest of his career to this day: the supernaturally weird black comedy (and weirdly-titled) BEETLEJUICE (1988). It was so unique, so strange to me that I didn't know what to make of it when I first saw it on video in 1989. I remember from that first time liking parts of it, but not liking the picture as a whole. The movie was so frenetic, so odd in its mixture of Goth Horror, Comedy, gruesome visual effects (I'm still kind of amazed that it got a PG rating instead of PG-13) and cartoonish slapstick that I really didn't know what to make if it. Well, now that I've seen it at least a half-dozen times since (three of them in the past year alone), I can say that it has held up better than many of the most popular 80's films (TOP GUN, etc) and has become a classic all unto itself.<p>With BEETLEJUICE, Tim Burton showed not only that he could direct effective comedy and illicit inspired performances from his actors, but also bring a true artist's touch to the big screen. Of course, the film won the Oscar for Best Makeup (as if there was any real question about it), but I also think that it should have also been at least nominated for Visual Effects and Art Direction, as those truly mesmerizing aspects all come together to create a product that is so unique. Not only that, but this film helped make the careers of several actors who would go on to major success soon after.<p>Two of those actors are Alec Baldwin and Geena Davis, as the ill-fated newlyweds Adam and Barbara Maitland who, after buying a big Victorian dream house at the film's outset, die in a bizarre car accident soon after. Slowly realizing that they've passed on to the next world, they don't want to give up their house to the pathetically bourgeois Charles &amp; Delia Deetz (Jeffrey Jones &amp; Catherine O'Hara), who along with their chubby, effete chauffeur Otho (Glenn Shadix) have already moved in, and inspire true disgust in the newly-dead couple. However, they seem to have an ally in the older couple's death-obsessed Goth daughter Lydia (Winona Ryder) see an afterlife advertisement for a &quot;Bio-Exorcist&quot; named Betelgeuse (Michael Keaton) and decide that their only hope in driving out the destestable Charles, Delia, and Otho is in using the wild, unpredictable Betelgeuse. Of course, good ol' Betelgeuse will gladly provide his unique brand of service, but at a very high price. <p>Alec Baldwin &amp; Geena Davis fill their roles very well. The ironic thing is that this was the first film I'd ever seen Alec Baldwin in, so my first impression of him as the nerdy, good-natured Adam ended up being turned around by 180 degrees by the psychotic, tough-guy roles that would define the rest of his career. That turnabout came pretty quickly, actually, as the very next film I would see him in was MARRIED TO THE MOB (1988), in which he was a mobster unbeknownst to his wife who gets offed early on, but it was his psychotic turn in the extremely quirky and violent MIAMI BLUES (1989) that really shocked me and made me realize that Alec really had some range to him (unfortunately, he would be end up being typecast as psychos for the rest of his career). However, Geena Davis, herself at the cusp of stardom (and Oscar acclaim) is playing pretty much the quirky kind of character that would eventually define her career. In fact, it was just the following year that she would win the Oscar for Best Supporting Actress for playing the truly quirky and inspired Muriel Pritchett in the otherwise uninspired THE ACCIDENTAL TOURIST (1989). This film, of course, also boosted the career of the now-infamous Winona Ryder, who quickly became the hot new &quot;it&quot; girl in the late 80's with this movie and with others soon to follow: 1969 (1988), HEATHERS (1989), GREAT BALLS OF FIRE! (also 1989), EDWARD SCISSORHANDS (1990, and another Tim Burton film) and MERMAIDS (also 1990). Of course, former AMADEUS (1984) emperor and FERRIS BUELLER'S DAY OFF (1986) principal Jeffrey Jones, now infamous for his own reasons, is also terrific here, as is former &quot;SC-TV&quot; alumnus Catherine O'Hara. We also get a welcome supporting performance from the great old character actress, Sylvia Sidney, as the chain-smoking receptionist Juno!<p>But it was Michael Keaton, who was already an up-and-coming comedic actor known for quirky hit comedies such as the Ron Howard-directed NIGHT SHIFT (1982), MR. MOM (1983), JOHNNY DANGEROUSLY (1984) and GUNG HO (1986), who really stole the show and hit paydirt in the process. He would immediately be elevated to &quot;A&quot; list status with his truly brilliant, maniacal and hilarious performance as the titular Betelgeuse, going immediately on to bigger &amp; better things with Tim Burton himself, starring soon after as BATMAN (1989)! It's funny; I think that in 1988, Keaton was robbed of Oscar nominations not only for this truly unique comedic role, but for also his surprising dramatic turn as a recovering alcoholic in CLEAN AND SOBER. It just shows that, for whatever reason, comedians just don't get recognized enough for their acting ability.<p>BEETLEJUICE is a lot of fun. It looks like it must have been a lot of fun to make. Despite the liberal PG rating, I would recommend it only for ages 9 &amp; up, as the humor is quite adult and the rather gruesome visuals are likely to give any young child nightmares. It is still a truly unique movie with incredible special effects, and it still makes me laugh to this day. Oddly enough, whenever I see it, it makes me that much less afraid to die!<p>HIGHLY RECOMMENDED\\n\",\n",

Not only that, but this film helped make the careers of several actors who would go on to major success soon after.<p>Two of those actors are Alec Baldwin and Geena Davis, as the ill-fated newlyweds Adam and Barbara Maitland who, after buying a big Victorian dream house at the film's outset, die in a bizarre car accident soon after. Slowly realizing that they've passed on to the next world, they don't want to give up their house to the pathetically bourgeois Charles &amp; Delia Deetz (Jeffrey Jones &amp; Catherine O'Hara), who along with their chubby, effete chauffeur Otho (Glenn Shadix) have already moved in, and inspire true disgust in the newly-dead couple. However, they seem to have an ally in the older couple's death-obsessed Goth daughter Lydia (Winona Ryder) see an afterlife advertisement for a &quot;Bio-Exorcist&quot; named Betelgeuse (Michael Keaton) and decide that their only hope in driving out the destestable Charles, Delia, and Otho is in using the wild, unpredictable Betelgeuse. Of course, good ol' Betelgeuse will gladly provide his unique brand of service, but at a very high price. <p>Alec Baldwin &amp; Geena Davis fill their roles very well. The ironic thing is that this was the first film I'd ever seen Alec Baldwin in, so my first impression of him as the nerdy, good-natured Adam ended up being turned around by 180 degrees by the psychotic, tough-guy roles that would define the rest of his career. That turnabout came pretty quickly, actually, as the very next film I would see him in was MARRIED TO THE MOB (1988), in which he was a mobster unbeknownst to his wife who gets offed early on, but it was his psychotic turn in the extremely quirky and violent MIAMI BLUES (1989) that really shocked me and made me realize that Alec really had some range to him (unfortunately, he would be end up being typecast as psychos for the rest of his career). However, Geena Davis, herself at the cusp of stardom (and Oscar acclaim) is playing pretty much the quirky kind of character that would eventually define her career. In fact, it was just the following year that she would win the Oscar for Best Supporting Actress for playing the truly quirky and inspired Muriel Pritchett in the otherwise uninspired THE ACCIDENTAL TOURIST (1989).

(also 1989), EDWARD SCISSORHANDS (1990, and another Tim Burton film) and MERMAIDS (also 1990). Of course, former AMADEUS (1984) emperor and FERRIS BUELLER'S DAY OFF (1986) principal Jeffrey Jones, now infamous for his own reasons, is also terrific here, as is former &quot;SC-TV&quot; alumnus Catherine O'Hara.

MOM (1983), JOHNNY DANGEROUSLY (1984) and GUNG HO (1986), who really stole the show and hit paydirt in the process. He would immediately be elevated to &quot;A&quot; list status with his truly brilliant, maniacal and hilarious performance as the titular Betelgeuse, going immediately on to bigger &amp; better things with Tim Burton himself, starring soon after as BATMAN (1989)! It's funny; I think that in 1988, Keaton was robbed of Oscar nominations not only for this truly unique comedic role, but for also his surprising dramatic turn as a recovering alcoholic in CLEAN AND SOBER. It just shows that, for whatever reason, comedians just don't get recognized enough for their acting ability.<p>BEETLEJUICE is a lot of fun. It looks like it must have been a lot of fun to make. Despite the liberal PG rating, I would recommend it only for ages 9 &amp; up, as the humor is quite adult and the rather gruesome visuals are likely to give any young child nightmares.

              " \"Tim Burton had come off the blockbuster success of his first feature film PEE-WEE'S BIG ADVENTURE (1985) when he was greenlighted by Warner Bros. to direct the project he REALLY wanted to make. It was the picture that would define the rest of his career to this day: the supernaturally weird black comedy (and weirdly-titled) BEETLEJUICE (1988). It was so unique, so strange to me that I didn't know what to make of it when I first saw it on video in 1989. I remember from that first time liking parts of it, but not liking the picture as a whole. The movie was so frenetic, so odd in its mixture of Goth Horror, Comedy, gruesome visual effects (I'm still kind of amazed that it got a PG rating instead of PG-13) and cartoonish slapstick that I really didn't know what to make if it.

This will let you know exactly how hot this sauce is. While I would bet most people use this sauce as an additive in other foods like salsa or chili, I like to put it on burittos (the football sized ones from mexican resturants), about one drop every third bite. But if you eat it that way, be prepared to pay the price. Your mouth will burn with no relief in sight. Your sinuses will clear and your nose will run uncontrollably. Your eyes may turn red, and you might have a hard time breathing. And don't forget about that second burn, the next time you use the toilet (that is a serious warning. I was at a mexican resturant with a friend who ate dave's on his burrito. Dave's kicked in and he had to go. Everyone in the resturant could hear him howling in pain while he was in the bathroom). I only know of one other person who can eat the sauce as a sauce. Everyone else who has tried it has begged for an ambulance or help. It is that hot. And I love it.<p>One other note. If you use it as an additive, a little will crank up the heat level of most foods. If you don't think the hot salsa from the grocery store is hot, a few drops of this will make that salsa much hotter. But do yourself a favor, and make your own salsa. It is easy. I chop up two jalepenjo peppers, a onions, a can of diced tomatoes, maybe subsitute a chipolte if i want more sweetness, the juice of a lime, and a dash of dave's. Salt it and let it sit in the fridge for an hour. After an hour, drain the liquid into the blender, and add in one more can of canned tomatoes. Blend it, and then add it back to the salsa mixing it up. For something different, chop up a bit of mint for the salsa. It will give an odd taste.

Well if they missed ingredients that's still ok only if it tastes good because other products also use sugar and preservative. However it was the worst dried mango I ever had. It is neither pleasing nor healthful. I already lost money spending on it and didn't want to bother my mouth nor my health with the worst. So, I threw away the whole bag decisively. No attachment. I recommend philipine imported dired mango products. 7D mango is fine. For your reference, I bought some organic or natural dried mangoes. They are quite different from philipine products. They are real dry and somewhat hard rather than soft and chewy like philipine products. But they use no sugar no preservative.\\n\",\n",

They have been on it since they were 4 months old.  I did a lot of research into food recommended by my breeder since we spent a lot of money on the cats.  I ultimately decided on this brand because of the research they have done.  I plan on putting both of them on the Persian formula (that is for Himalayans and Burmese too) because these types of cats are prone to getting a certain type of UTI and need their urine a different pH.<br />Their fur has never been softer, they are so active and always chasing each other, they are very playful with us.  We always comment on how soft the older one is, just like a pillow, and the younger one is getting closer every day.  They eat the food I leave out for them every day, so I'm assuming it is satisfying.  I just love this brand and plan on sticking with them, even when we get dogs.\\n\",\n",

The texture is chewy, but not too soft or sticky.  They are a tad less sweet than &quot;See's Licorice Medallions&quot;, but just as flavorful.

              " 'You have heard the story about how the Baby Ruth candy bear was not named for Babe Ruth but for Ruth Cleveland, daughter of President Grover Cleveland.  Well, sorry to disappoint you, but that story is not true.  The first Baby Ruth bars were made by the Curtiss Candy Company, which was founded in Chicago in 1916 by Otto Schnering, who used his mother\\'s maiden name since it was much more American-sounding and would not cause the problems that a German surname would during World War I.  The first confection made by Curtiss was the Kandy Kate, which featured a pastry center topped with nuts and coated with chocolate.  Then in 1921 revised the product so that was now a log-shaped bar made of caramel and peanuts, covered in chocolate.  Priced at only five cents, half the cost of competing candy bars, Schnering named it the Baby Ruth bar, which soon became one of the hottest selling candies on the market.<br /><br />Now, the explanation that the candy bar was named for \"Baby\" Ruth Cleveland, the former President\\'s first-born daughter, has been the official explanation proffered by the Curtiss Candy Company since the 1920\\'s while the Babe Ruth legend has been the obvious explanation, especially since Ruth had joine the Yankees in 1920 and in 1921, the year the Baby Ruth debuted, he hit a then-record 59 home runs.  However, the idea that the Baby Ruth bar was named after Ruth Cleveland is rather morbid given she died of diptheria at the age of 12 in 1904, seventeen years before the candy bar was named.<br /><br />The more reasonable explanation seems that the Curtiss Candy Company did indeed find a way to link their product to the Yankee slugger who was becoming the most famous person in the country.  Ironically, Curtiss had to fight off a challenge from a competitor who was attempting to market the Babe Ruth Home Run Bar, endorsed by the Babe himself.  The Curtiss claim that the bar was named for Ruth Cleveland was enough to fight off the challenge, since the names were too close to one another to allow the new product to be marketed that way.  The fact that Curtiss maintained for years that the Baby Ruth bar came out before years before Babe Ruth became famous is enough to pop the balloon since in 1920 Ruth had broken his single season home run record of 29 by hitting 54 round trippers.<br /><br />Of course all that matters now is that this is still a classic American candy bar.  Beneath the milk chocolate coating of Nestles popular 2.1 ounce candy bar is a chewy, peanut-covered center, wrapped in a nougat that is really more of a white or blonde fudge.  In terms of caloric ration the Baby Ruth is 46% Carbs, 48% Fats, and 6% Protein.  The candy bar is low in Sodium and very low in Cholesterol, which is good, but high in Saturated Fat, which is supposedly bad (where do people think the taste comes from?).  A large portion of the calories come from the sugars, which is how nature intended it.  If you want a candy bar with actual peanuts in it, the Baby Ruth is still a good choice.<br /><br />Ironically, I did find a Champion Cocker Spaniel named Baby Ruth, whelped in 1892, who was in all probability actually named for President Cleveland\\'s daughter, Ruth, who had been the first child to be born in the White House the previous year.  She was bred by Joseph Smith of Canada and sold to Andrew Laidlaw and became the foundation on which Mepal built one of the strongest kennels in the United States.  All three Best in Show Cocker Spaniels at the Westminster Dog Show could trace their pedigree back to this particular Baby Ruth.\\n',\n",

At the young age of thirty, and in only his second full length feature, Burton created a cult favorite that is one for the ages. In this bizarre, off-beat script by Michael McDowell (who collaborated with him before on an episode of the `Alfred Hitchcock Presents' television series) he found the ideal vehicle for his unique and strange imagination - and indeed, Burton's unique vision is more apparent here than in any of his movies, The Nightmare Before Christmas being the happy exception. Though it's true that it's not as personal a creation as `Nightmare' or Edward Scissorhands, this is the movie that would place Burton on the map as a major director, and would earn him his breakthrough job - directing the first Batman feature film. It is on Beetlejuice that he would also start several long-time collaborations with actors who would work with him again in the future - Michael Keaton (Batman &amp; Batman Returns), Winona Ryder (Edward Scissorhands), Jeffrey Jones (Ed Wood, Sleepy Hollow), Glenn Shadix and Catherine O'Hara (both of whom did voiceovers for Nightmare Before Christmas).<p>So, again, while Beetlejuice isn't as deep and personal film as we would see in Nightmare Before Christmas, Edward Scissorhands, Ed Wood or Big Fish, Beetlejuice is an incredibly imaginative and captivating film and is a perfect black comedy. Geena Davis and Alec Baldwin are both more than adequate, but Michael Keaton in the title part is of course the real star of the show - although in reality his part is much smaller than those of Davis and Baldwin. Keaton is electric and mesmerizing as the bio-exorcist or `the Ghost with the Most', Beetlejuice (spelled BETELGEUSE!), probably the greatest and most memorable performance of his career (with the possible exception of the part of Batman). Keaton really let loose in Beetlejuice, and he and Burton were seemingly having a blast - they created one of the most memorable horror and comedy characters on the big screen. Seventeen year old Winona is also terrific as Goth-girl Lydia, fascinated and repulsed by Betelgeuse's extreme personality. Similarities between her character here and the one in Edward Scissorhands are easy to find, but for my money her performance as Lydia is the better one.<p>And in conclusion, if there's any movie that I'd recommend to own on VCR or DVD, it's Beetlejuice; because Burton at his best made films that are well rewarding in repeated viewing, and Beetlejuice is Burton at his very, very best, even if it's not his best film.

Add a little honey and you almost won't mind having a sore throat as an excuse to drink it.  It's strong if you steep as long as the manufacturer suggests, but that is up to you.  I love that it's ingredients are so pure, and though I'm not sure that it actually HEALS the body, it FEELS like it does, and that's half the fun.\\n\",\n",

The fact is, Brown &amp; Haley, the makers of Almond Roca, beloved by millions of fellow sweet-toothers, is based right here in my hometown of Tacoma, Washington. That's right, the place of the infamous &quot;Tacoma aroma&quot; is also the home of the very sweet aroma of Almond Roca, and has been for over one hundred years!<p>Almond Roca is a bite-size combination of milk chocolate with crushed almond pieces surrounding a core of rich butterscotch almond brittle, so it's kind of soft-but-crunchy &amp; chocolatey on the outside, and hard &amp; crunchy &amp; almond-sweet on the inside. My mouth is watering just describing it! I've got to get some right now....luckily, I can drive just three miles down Pacific Avenue to get it wholesale right from the source!<p>My hometown should be proud of the rich tradition of Brown &amp; Haley; if you're located nowhere near Tacoma and you've *never* tasted Almond Roca before, then what are you waiting for? Order the 7-ounce tin today, and give yourself---or the one you love---a treat that you or they will never forget!<p>MOST RECOMMENDED\\n\",\n",
              " 'I was first introduced to Son Kite back in 2000. I was going through my psycho trance phase and decided to give this group a go after a native of Sweden recommended the duo. So I did, but I had a very bad migraine that night and learned that headaches and trance are not a happy union. The collective eventually grew on me and that was around the time when their first CD Minologue came out. Shoot forward four years, and along comes Colours. This CD is pimp. It is much more dance-friendly in my opinion than other things Son Kite have created. While Minologue was flat-out psychedelic trance, Colours ventures out into different genres. I can hear tidbits of progressive house, epic trance, and even a jazzy feel in these nine songs. Personal favorites include Jukebox, Games and Watch, and Focus. <p>I recommend this CD to anyone who is a fan of somewhat underground dance music.\\n',\n",

'Evilspeak' as a title doesn't have anything to do with the film itself, but that's fine.  It is one of those rare horror gems that wrings every cent of value from its limited budget.<p>Clint Howard is a downtrodden military school cadet who no one likes - he is beaten up by his fellow classmates, smacked around by his teachers, and beaten by the school chaplain (!). In despair, Clint conjures a long-dead devil through an Apple II computer.  (Yep, it turns out the Steve Jobs is evil incarnate after all!)  Who knew that Satan's minions could be called with an old Apple II with a dual-floppy drive?  Wouldn't it be easier to just call collect?<p>An explosive and gory revenge-fest follows....with explosions, swords, and wild pigs.  Pigs were great in 'Hannibal', but this movie did it first.<p>Clint Howard's only problem is the inevitable comparisons to Ron Howard.  But Clint is a fine genre actor and he brings some fine moments to this 'B' flick.  But be warned, this movie is disturbing and extremely violent.  <p>Recommended.\\n\",\n",

She dives in and tears it apart - she would work on it non-stop if I didn't periodically take it away from her.  The meat and tendons are harmless enough - obviously they have fat and protein so they have to be tied into diet considerations, and the bone appears to hold onto the flavor long after it's stripped (she still licks and gnaws on a bone that's a few weeks bare).  The knuckles, once they get torn off, should probably be thrown away after a few minutes because they are small enough to be swallowed and/or choked on.  The only downside to this product is when she comes up to me and the whiskers around her mouth are a little discolored and she smells like roasted meat.

The dried chiles add a slightly smoky essence with more dimension than Tabasco or similar hot sauces. The heat level is fairly moderate, which allows the sauce to season your food while not overwhelming it. However, the sauce sometimes seems a little watery or bland.<br /><br /> Cholula adds great flavor to a variety of foods, although I like it best on scrambled eggs; a plethora of recipes are available on the official website. With only 20mg of sodium per teaspoon, Cholula is one of the best sauces available for persons trying to avoid sodium.

In my opinion, scorch in a good way.<br /><br /> The price is great. You'd spend that much at any store, buying a far lower quality of jerky, and just try finding habanero ANYTHING at Safeway.<br /><br /> Kudos to Amazon for removing yet one more thing from my shopping list. Additional kudos to Mahogany Smoked Meats for having such a wonderful product.<br /><br /> I've taken one star off for the jerky being so sticky (I guess it's the sugar?), and the difficulty of separating out the pieces of jerky themselves.<br /><br /> Definitely recommended.\\n\",\n",

              " \"Evilspeak (1982), written and directed by Eric Weston, features Ron Howard's lesser known, but more prolific brother Clint Howard (both started out on the classic television series The Andy Griffith Show, as Opie and Leon, respectively).  During the 70's, both brothers starred in a spate of schlocky B movies like Eat My Dust! (1976) and Grand Theft Auto (1977), (most likely due to the fact that they probably had great difficulty in breaking out of the roles they played as children) to name a couple, and while brother Ron used the opportunity to get into directing (he directed the latter of the two films mentioned), his brother Clint seemed content to keep working in front of the cameras, enjoying his status of forever the character actor dwelling on the Hollywood fringe, managing to develop a long, successful career out of it, even making supporting appearances in some of his brothers films (ahhh, sweet nepotism), like Far and Away (1992), Apollo 13 (1995), and Edtv (1999), but his destiny seems to lie in the world of the B movie, and it seems to fit him perfectly.<br /><br />In this film, Clint plays Stanley Coopersmith, a cadet at a military school.  Stanley possesses an above average IQ, is odd looking, an orphan, a loner, and is highly uncoordinated (his fumbling of the ball during the school's soccer matches leads to much angering of the other players along with the coach).  All of these things add up to incessant picking on by a popular clique led by Bubba (played by Don Stark, whom I recognized but couldn't place until I read that he currently appears on the TV show That 70's Show as the goofy neighbor Bob Pinciotti...man, he's really changed, and not for the better).  They harass Stanley constantly, playing all sorts of pranks on him and just making his life miserable.  Stanley is also harassed by others, like his soccer coach, the school's commandant, and even the school's priest, to some degree.  What's a nerd to do?  Well, the answer comes one day while Stanley is cleaning the basement of the school's church as punishment, which happens to have some secret catacombs as the current church sits atop a much older church erected by people cast out of their homeland so many hundreds of years ago and left on the shores of America for their heresy in following religions darker path.  Stanley finds a secret room, which contains many things, including a dark tome, spelling out rituals of evil and instructions on performing black mass.  With the help of an Apple computer borrowed from the school's library, Stanley intends on calling up dark powers to aid him in dealing with his tormentors, but will he get more than he bargained for?  You bet he will...<br /><br />Clint is always fun to watch, and he doesn't disappoint here.  Turning to the dark side to gain supernatural powers to use against my enemies wouldn't have been my first choice, but to each his own.  The story itself is pretty solid, despite various plot holes, and moves along at a steady pace, keeping the viewer's interest throughout until the film's end.  There is a pretty good heaping of gore and nastiness, specifically near the end of the film, along with a couple of scenes with nekkid women (the scene with the secretary taking a shower seemed a bit odd, as she appeared to have a problem with one of her milk glands, as if it was partially deflated somehow, but I digress).  One thing I found interesting was the level of revenge exacted on Stanley's tormentors seemed proportional to the amount of harassment they inflicted on him.  Decapitations, death by possessed pig, removal of vital organs, etc., it's here and more.  Clint is backed up by a rich supporting cast, including veteran film and television actors R.G. Armstrong (Race with the Devil), Joseph Cortese (American History X), Claude Earl Jones (Used Cars), Heywood Nelson (Dwayne from the TV show What's Happening!), and Charles Tyner (The Outlaw Josey Wales).  Probably the element that will put people off most is the exceptionally cheap looking animated graphics supposed to simulate on screen computer graphics, but I found it kind of charming, in its' own cheesy way.  The film's not really scary, but it does get pretty graphic, and those with a weak stomach would probably do well to avoid this film.<br /><br />This release from Anchor Bay Entertainment boasts a restored and uncut version of the film, which means some of the more gory and graphic scenes of bloody carnage removed due to the MPAA's (Motion Picture Association of America) ever changing archaic rules and regulations (this is the group that gave the film Midnight Cowboy, which later won the Oscar for best picture, an unnecessary X rating at the time of its' release) have been put back in...this is one of my favorite aspects about the DVD format, being the opportunity to see movies as they were originally intended to be seen, before they were hacked up in an effort to satisfy some pain in the rear censorship board.  The special features contained on this release include a good-looking wide screen format (some scratches are present), an entertaining audio commentary by writer/producer/director Eric Weston, a production cast member named Warren Lewis, and star Clint Howard, a original theatrical trailer, biographies, a photo gallery, and booklet insert with liner notes.  If I learned anything from this film, it's that it's not unusual for a military academy to keep a stall of pigs on premises.  It certainly serves a purpose as you can have your underachieving cadets clean the pen as a form of punishment, allowing for a less than surefooted victim to slip and fall into all sorts of nastiness...pig guano...ewwwww...overall, this is a three star film with an extra star for the special features.<br /><br />Cookieman108<br /><br />PS...look for Richard Moll, Bull on TV's Night Court, as Father Esteban...\\n\",\n",

              " 'These days, when a person says, \"chicken soup\" they\\'re probably going to follow up those words with, \"for the soul\" or maybe \"for the teenaged soul\".  Didn\\'t used to be that way.  Why I can remember a time when if a person said, \"chicken soup\" those words were followed by an enthusiastic \"with rice!\".  Such was the power of Maurice Sendak\\'s catchy 1962 children\\'s book.  I am pleased to report that if you care to read this book again today, you will find it hasn\\'t dimished a jot in terms of frolicksome fun.  In this book we are led through a whirlwind chicken soup year with our host, a boy who bears no little resemblance to Sendak\\'s other great rhyming tale \"Pierre\" (in looks if not demeanor).  It\\'s a catchy flouncy bouncy combo of soup and the people who love it so.<br /><br />This is ostensibly a book meant to teach your children the different months of the year.  Each month gets its own rhythmic poem and accompanying illustration.  These are fairly simple pen and ink drawings with the occasional splash of blue (in varying shades), yellow, gray, and green.  You may wonder how an author could ever hope to come up with twelve highly original soup-related poems.  I mean, honestly, how much is there to say about even the fanciest soup, let alone chicken soup with rice?  Quite a lot, as it happens.  In the cold winter months soup is supped while sliding on ice, while celebrating the birthday of a snowman, and in a gusty gale as a whale.  In the spring there\\'s robin\\'s nest soup, soup to cure drooping roses, and soup stolen by jealous March winds.  Our hero postulates the potential joys that could come of being a cooking pot, stewing soup or (oddly enough) as \"a baubled bangled Christmas tree\".<br /><br />Not to degrade the reading skills of parents everywhere, but I cannot recommend enough getting an audio version of this tale to accompany your child\\'s reading.  Though I am now a wise and cultured 26 year-old (the years have been kind to me in this, my old age) I can still remember the chicken soup with rice tune.  Heck, I read this entire book recently and found I could do the song perfectly with each and every line.  Now maybe you have your own particular chicken soup with rice song style that you\\'re just loathe to give up.  If so, fine.  I understand why you might not want to taint your already existing chicken soup melody.  But if you haven\\'t found a jingle to accompany this book, get the audio version immediately, if not sooner.  Until you can sing \"Whoopy once, whoopy twice, whoopy chicken soup with rice\" with the correct oomph, you\\'re missing out.<br /><br />I take my \"Chicken Soup With Rice\" readings seriously.  This book was the \"Chicka Chicka Boom Boom\" of its day, and still remains the catchiest method to teach kids the months of the year.  It is also seriously in danger of being forgotten.  So pull out your old accordion and strap on your dancing shoes.  The time for yukkin\\' it up to a merry dance of poultry broth is here.  It\\'s Sendak at his finest.\\n',\n",

In this case there is no comparison with the many rivals - it is the best - deep, throaty, refreshing aftertaste, a superb offering.\\n',\n",

Through Sendak's catchy story, children will also learn the months of the year, as well as what seasons go with what month! They learn to identify ice-skating and snowmen in the winter; strong wind in March; birds and flowers in the spring; swimming and hot temperatures in the summer; and finally different holidays throughout the year. Such as Halloween in October, and Christmas in December.<br /><br />Sendak's simple three colored crayon-like drawings are a perfect addition to his educational and entertaining story.<br /><br />A great activity that you can do with this book is to have children draw their own illustrations for each month of the year.  Afterwards you can bind the pages together so the children can create their own book.\\n\",\n",

I know there are at least two kinds -- Sri Lanka and Madagascar -- of cinnamon, it seems reasonable to me that a third might be adding the \"sweet\" flavor that the other reviewer mentioned.<br /><br />It is really just an amazing tea that I think most people will find themselves going through quickly. It\\'s a nice break from the standard black tea fare, if that\\'s what you normally drink.<br /><br />I can compare it to Rishi Tea\\'s \"The Fire\" (another \"spicy\" tea), and the big difference here is the body. Rishi\\'s offering has a very light boody, whereas this tea almost tastes like it\\'s had molasses added. Yum. All the spice, and character to boot.<br /><br />Highly recommended.\\n',\n",
              " 'For those of you not familiar with the great Urban Legend of the Red Velvet Cake recipe that cost $240 dollars, see Jan Harold Brunvan\\'s series of books on Urban Legends starting with THE VANISHING HITCHIKER available here on Amazon.  Most of us know the legend in it\\'s more modern form as the \"Mrs. Field\\'s Chocolate Chip cookie recipe\" that some poor unsuspecting soul requested and was told would cost \"Two-forty\" and who assumed that meant Two Dollars and forty cents only to receive a credit card bill of $240.  Needless to say the legend is NOT true, never WAS true & never will be true be it about the cookies, Red Velvet Cake or Waldorf Salad( Another part of the legend).<br /><br />Red Velvet Cake started out as a pretty and regional variant of Devil\\'s Food cake and is really just a wonderfully light chocolate cake with red colouring added to it.  It is often topped with either a vanilla buttercream frosting or in more modern times with cream cheese frosting.  The Duncan Hines mix is probably a better option than any of the current recipes floating around that are often remnents of the old Urband Legend for a variety of reasons.  Many of the legendary recipes have bizarre added ingredients intended to make the recipe look weird or authentic and often call for far more food coloring than is needed, imparting a bitter flavor and ghastly colour to the finished cake.<br /><br />Having had the Duncan Hines mix as a child and again more recently, I can attest to its superiority over most of the existing recipes for Red Velvet Cake.  The Duncan Hines Cake Mix has a lovely chocolate flavor and just the right amount of red color to make the final product interesting.  When made as a layer cake (preferabley with four thin layers as opposed to two thick ones) and topped with Cream cheese icing, the Duncan Hines Red Velvet Cake makes a wonderfully festive Holiday cake sure to provoke conversation.  You may find yourself having to give away a number of the boxes of mix you now have to friends eager to make it themselves and share the intriguing legend.  The finished cake truly is a show-stopper!<br /><br />Conventional wisdom is that the cake itself began as a Southern tradition and indeed, it can still be found on the dessert menus of some venerable Southern eateries.  The best I ever had was in Nashville at an old Inn but it wasn\\'t all that superior to the Duncan Hines mix which is more moist and lighter in texture than most Tradtional ( as opposed to \"legendary\" ) recipes.<br /><br />You can still find elaborate versions of Red Velvet cake popping up in places such as the Swiss Colony Holiday Catalog but for outragious prices.  Do what I do and make your own!  Since it is near impossible to find anywhere else, go ahead and order the mix here.  Even if you only make it a few times a year, the mix lasts a long time and is a good value when you consider its \"Star Quality\" as a dessert and a natural conversation piece!  I know of one mom whose daughter got an \\'A\\' when using the cake as a demonstration of modern Folklore in her high-school social studies class!<br /><br />If all that info isn\\'t enough inducement to try it...just remember..it\\'s chocolate cake for heaven\\'s sake!  And...it\\'s pretty!  What more could a person want?\\n',\n",

The canned filling also uses just the heart of the sweet potato, what most people call \"Yams\" so you get a better overall resultthat is smoother and sweeter than if you go about making a pie the old-fashioned way.  An added benefit is less mess and ease of clean-up.<br /><br />Unless you live in an area where Southern Cooking ingredients are easily available at the supermarket, you most likely will not find this product on the grocery store shelves.  Ordering it in quantity is not a bad idea since it stores well and when you do finally make it, more than one is usually in order.

The authetic mix guarantees you that Cafe Du Monde taste and they are relatively easy to fry up at home for a weekend morning treat.  Traditonally fried in Cottonseed oil, most home-cooks opt for a healthier, lighter oil but anyway you fry them, these are not exactly health food!<br /><br />Essentially, Beignets are fried dough covered with generous amounts of powedered sugar.  Traditionally served by themselves on a plate a of three with cups of Chicory coffee, you can, if you want, get adventurous and fill them with fruit (cherry works best) compote or sweet cream cheese for variety. You can also set a few sugared blueberries and a sprig of mint in the middle of a plate of three beignets for a classic presentation. They are so scrumptious that you needen't really offer anything else but some folks like to include Beignets as part of a larger brunch menu.  Me, I prefer just the Beignets with their traditional beverage, for a mid-morning light brunch.  These are best if fried up in large batches for a group since frying anything in small amounts seems like too much effort for too little outcome, but one box at a time is okay too.<br /><br />While there are plenty of beignet recipes out there, this mix is super-easy and carries the Cafe Du Monde name. They turn out well and taste very much like the real thing.  It is worth the effort to make sure you also serve up some Chicory Coffee as well since it is the pairing of the two that evokes the strong memory of nights in New Orleans.  The strong taste of the Chicory compliments the simplicity of the beignets beautifully.\\n\",\n",

              " 'This tiny jar of concentrated yeast extract is quite the breakfast food. To use Marmite, spread it thinly on toast or sandwich bread. Wait! What do you mean by \"thinly?\" I mean, practically thin enough to be  a monolayer of molecules, because if you spread it any thicker, it will taste pretty strong. Well, actually, I use a quarter of a teaspoon on each piece of toast, which is buttered first to lubricate the process. And wait, how would one spread it thinly on fresh, untoasted AMERICAN bread without it tearing the fluffy crumb into tiny balls only suitable for feeding the koi? Again, a bit of softened butter, then a schmear of Marmite, a slice of tomato and you have a super tea sandwich. This is often my dinner, when I want something light.<br /><br />How and why was Marmite invented, and how did it become a beloved British traditional food, right up there with hedgehog-flavoured potato crisps? Back in 1902, some genius took the lees of good old British Ale, that is to say, Brewer\\'s Yeast, and boiled it down to a tarry, black substance that no one in their right mind would eat unless their Mum forced them to. Because of the B-complex, Marmite became popular as a supplement for prisoners-of-war, served in hospitals, schools, to troops in WWI and WWII. It almost was rationed in WWII, with mothers told to spread it \"very thinly, for now.\"<br /><br />Traditionally, Marmite is served on sandwiches and especially on toast at breakfast on toast \"soldiers\" or triangles of toast that kids can dip into their boiled eggs. The flavor is meaty, salty, though it has less salt than the butter you might use with it, and it has no meat or animal product--it\\'s made of yeast so is vegetarian-vegan.<br /><br />The flavor, frankly, takes some getting used to if you don\\'t like strong, savory things. However, if you like savory, meaty flavors and want something non-sugary sweet on  your breakfast toast, Marmite is fantastic. The closest I can describe the flavor is on the order of soy sauce, beef bouillion or mushroom pate. Other uses for Marmite are to flavor soups, meat or vegetable loaves, and stews, as a mix in dips or on bread for sandwiches and canapes.<br /><br />4 grams or about 1/8 ounce of Marmite has the following B vitamins:<br /><br />Riboflavin  0.28mg (17.5% RDA)<br />Niacin  5.4mg (35.6% RDA)<br />Folic Acid  100ug (50.0% RDA)<br />Vitamin B12  0.5ug (60.0% RDA)\\n',\n",

I'm not a huge fan of Starbucks, I find their coffee too bitter, but like everyone else I truck over there spending close to $4.00 a cup on a specialty latte. This is different. This is like the coffee I had every morning in Provence. It has great flavor and the frothy top is something you could never get with your regular coffee maker. I love that I can do one cup at a time, so my coffee isn't sitting on the warming plate losing its flavor until I'm ready for another cup. It froths itself, so you don't have to deal with complicated and hard to clean steaming mechanisms. It takes a minute to boil the water and then less than 30 seconds to fill the cup, which is much quicker than making regular coffee. It is easy to put together, take apart and clean; in fact, when I was comparing the similar-looking Mr. Coffee and Black and Decker brands in the store I couldn't get those two models back together after I looked at the pod holder, which cinched the decision for me on the Senseo (which has a very simple press-down locking mechanism). I'm so glad!!! I haven't tried the dark roast yet, but we love the medium and the decaf, and the mild is nice for afternoon. I was worried about the cost of the pods until I realized that a bag of 18 is under $4.00, which is like 22 cents a pod.

              " 'The history of soft drinks goes all the way back to the mineral water found in natural springs.  The first marketed (non-carbonated) soft drinks, made from water and lemon juice sweetened with honey, appeared in the 17th century. The first drinkable manmade glass of carbonated water was created by an Englishmen, Dr. Joseph Priestley, nine years before the Declaration of Independence.  In 1832, John Mathews invented an apparatus for making carbonated water.  The drinking of natural (or even artificial) mineral water was considered a healthy practice so American pharmacists were adding medicinal and other flavorful herbs (birch bark, sarsaparilla, fruit extracts) to unflavored beverage from their soda fountains.  Then their customers wanted to start taking the drinks home with them and thus the soft drink bottling industry was born, leading eventually to \"Rock and Roller Cola Wars.\"<br /><br />In 1893 in New Bern, North Carolina, a young pharmacist named Caleb Bradham began experimenting with a wide variety of different soft drink concoctions that friends and patrons could try out at his drugstore soda fountain.  Five year\\'s later the most popular formulation, known as \"Brad\\'s Drink,\" a combination of carbonated water, sugar, vanilla, rare oils and cola nuts, is named Pepsi-Cola and in 1902 the company was incorporated.  The product was sold with the slogan: \"Exhilarating, Invigorating, Aids Digestion.\"  By 1995 the company\\'s slogan was \"Nothing else is a Pepsi.\"  PepsiCo.\\'s restaurant division, Tircon Global Restaurants, Inc., which includes Pizza Hut, Taco Bell, & KFC, is the largest restaurant company in the world in terms of units and second-largest in sales (go ahead and guess who is bigger and what cola they happen to sell).<br /><br />Here we have 144 fluid ounces of Pepsi Cola divided into a dozen 12 ounce cans as the \"6-Pack\" goes the way of the nickle bottle of Pepsi.  Today, Pepsi is a concoction of carbonated water, high fructose corn syrup and/or sugar, caramel color, phosphoric acid, caffeine, citric acid and natural flavors.  The high fructose corn syrup and/or sugar part has me puzzled, simply because I would think that once a corporation has a major formula they do not mess with it in any way shape or form.  So now I am wondering if the taste difference between high fructose corn syrup based Pepsi Cola and sugar based Pepsi Cola is as significant as the difference between soda fountain Pepsi Cola and Pepsi Cola in a can (the latter is better).  In addition to the 150 calories per 12 fluid ounce serving you get the following percentage daily values (based on a 2,000 calorie diet):<br /><br />Total Fat (0g) 0%<br />Sodium (35 mg) 1%<br />Potassium (10 mg)<br />Total Carbohydrates (41 g of Sugars)  14%<br />Protein (0 g) 0%<br /><br />There is also 25 mg of caffeine, a fact that is not included in the Nutrition Facts on the side of the can, which I find interesting because I know I am not alone in drinking Pepsi for the caffeine instead of the sodium or sugars.  But I also know that I like the sweeter more refreshing taste of Pepsi as compared to the competition (Bill Cosby once dismissed the idea that we wanted cola with a \"sweeter\" taste, but he was wrong).<br /><br />When I was in England several years ago I saw a whole bunch of ad posters in which things that were traditionally red over there, such as mailboxes and phone booths, were suddenly blue.  Of course I now know this was in anticipation of Pepsi going from white cans to blue cans.  You might wonder how much money was spent to determine that blue versus red was a better marketing position than white versus red, but when you are going up against a product whose brand name has become the generic name for cola, you need to look for every marketing opportunity.<br /><br />For most of us the history of Pepsi is found not in the can (or the bottle), but the advertising slogans.  See how far back in history you can go down this trip along memory lane: \"Be Young. Have Fun. Drink Pepsi\" (1993), \"Choice of a New Generation\" (1992), \"You Got The Right One Baby\" (1990), \"The choice of a New Generation\" (1984), \"Have a Pepsi Day!\" (1976), \"Pepsi Generation\" (1962), \"Now it\\'s Pepsi, for those who think young\" (1960), \"The Light Refreshment\" (1953), \"Bigger Drink, Better Taste\" (1943), \"Drink Pepsi-Cola, it will satisfy you\" (1920), and \"The Original Food Drink\" (1906).\\n',\n",

Tim Burton knew what he was doing, aparently, because this film is unbelievably entertaining. The dialogue is clever, the story is wonderful and the characters make the film shine. Winona Rider is marvelous as the troubled gothic teenager who wears black and veils to the dinner table. Her mother is a power woman designer who turns the house into a Tim Burton Dream land where all sorts of goodies can happen, especially with a little tampering from a few ghosts. This film also has a great score from Danny Elfman who worked with him previously on Batman and Pee Wee's Big Adventure. After this the director/composer duo have never split up and togehter they create magic for everyone to see and love.\\n\",\n",

Originating with the small-time, private, mid-19th century plantations of a British civil surgeon named Dr. Campbell, tea has long since transformed the region into a major economic center, with over 80 running gardens producing over 10 million kgs (over 22 million lbs) of tea on a total area of almost 20,000 hectares (approximately 75 square miles), and employing over 50,000 people on a permanent basis, with a further 15,000 being hired during the plucking season (March - November). The area\\'s natural climate with its mixture of rainfall, sunshine and rich soil makes for a very distinctive flavor, and to be called \"Darjeeling,\" tea *must* have been grown *and* processed in that particular region.<br /><br />Darjeeling tea comes in several harvest varieties or \"flushes\": the lighter Easter harvest or first flush, and the stronger Spring harvest or second flush, which has an unmistakeably fruity, Muscatel-like note. (There is also a Summer harvest or third flush, which is even stronger than the tea from the second harvest, but it is somewhat less refined and therefore less popular than the first two varieties.)

              " \"This review is written for Pill Pockets for Cats (Amazon ASIN:B00061MVTG). Amazon will sometimes post this review next to Greenies Pill Pockets. Unless Greenies bought Pill Pockets for Cats and has reissued it under their label, this is a mistake. I've NEVER TRIED GREENIES. I took my original 2004 review down and am reposting it with this warning.<br /><br />Pill Pockets for Cats are soft, hollow, little cat treats. They are shaped like a cup. The concept is simple. Put the pill in the opening and then seal it by pinching it closed, then feed it to your cat. Our cat was a little hesitant the first couple times, so we would put a little catfood gravy on it (which she adores). She ate it right up. Sometimes she would get fussy and not eat it (mainly because she's an annoying, spoiled little critter), but I've found that dressing it up with dried bonito flakes works really well too. Now she looks forward to her daily treat and would remind me if she didn't get it.<br /><br />The pockets in the first bag were similar to the consistency of Velveeta, though the second bag was a little more dried out and tended to crumble. Our cat prefers the pill pockets when they are moist, but she will still eat the drier ones. I think that the product dries out as it sits on the shelf. If you are buying the product from a store (as opposed to Amazon), shake the bag. If it rattles a lot like the pieces are loose, the product is more likely to be dry and crumbly.<br /><br />Unless you have a lot of cats, I don't recommend buying the product in large quantities. After the bag is opened, the product tends to start drying out. For us, the 45-count bag was just right, by the time we got to the bottom, the pills were drier, but still moist enough for my cat to eat them without too much coaxing.<br /><br />Our veterinarian prescribed tiny tablets for our cat (cut in half), so there is plenty of room to spare. I would guess that you could probably fit a pill the size of an aspirin in there, but you might have to stretch it a bit.<br /><br />The Pill Pockets are a bit pricey (around $7 for 45 pieces), but it's so much easier than stuffing a pill down the cat's throat, that it's really worth it.<br /><br />Pill Pockets for Cats (salmon flavor) comes in a metallic pinkish bag. The chicken flavor comes in a yellowish bag, but we've never tried it.. Pill Pockets for Cats used to come in clear plastic bags, but I think they found that opaque bags keeps the product fresh longer. Greenies comes in a green bag.\\n\",\n",

              " 'It was in the 1920s that the H.B. Reese Candy Company first began manufacturing a product made with specially processed peanut butter and Hershey\\'s milk chocolate. Back then the product was simply known as peanut butter cups, but today the popular candy is known as Reese\\'s Peanut Butter Cups. Harry Burnett Reese was actually a former dairy employee of Milton S. Hershey, the founder of the Hershey Foods Corporation who was inspired by the example and went off to make his own fortune in the candy industry. Reese made a lot of other products, such as Johnny Bars (caramel-like molasses) and Lizzie Bars (coconut candy), but in the end his fortune was made by this single product, which offered a simple combination of peanut butter and chocolate.<br /><br />In the 1920s, from a factory located down the street from that of Hershey, Reese began selling his peanut butter cups in 5 lb. boxes to be used in candy assortments. In the 1930s he added the cups, which were originally sold for a penny each. During World War II Reese discontinued all his other products and just made the peanut butter cups, which were distributed through wholesale jobbers, vending machine operators and syndicated stores. After World War II the peanut butter cups, now in their familiar orange, yellow and brown wrapping, continued to gain national popularity. In 1963 the H.B. Reese Candy Company, Inc., was sold for $23.5 million to the Hershey Chocolate Company, and in 1976 the first variation in the Reese\\'s Peanut Butter Cup was made with the introduction of Reese\\'s Crunchy Peanut Butter Cup.<br /><br />In 1992 Reese\\'s started selling its own peanut butter in a jar, in 1994 it offered Reese\\'s bits for baking, and in 1998 the company launched ReeseSticks to go along with the Fastbreak, Nutrageous, and Bites, not to mention peanut butter Christmas trees, pumpkins, eggs, and all the other seasonal products. Now even have White Chocolate Reese\\'s Peanut Butter Cups, which pretty much defines heaven on earth for me in terms of candy making. But behind this growing array of candy products there remains the original Reese\\'s Peanut Butter Cup. There is something to be said for the simple combination of peanut butter and chocolate, as immortalized in the \"you got chocolate in my peanut butter/you got peanut butter in my chocolate\" ad campaign that inspired many Americans to walk around eating peanut butter out of a jar.<br /><br />Now, you can certainly make your own peanut butter cups. You just need 12 paper muffin cups, a 12-ounce package of milk chocolate chips, a cup of reduced-fat peanut butter, 1/2 cup of powdered sugar, a 1/4 of a teaspoon of salt, a pair of scissors, microwave, and refrigerator. But it will take you a couple of hours to make 12 candies. Or you can buy this pair of peanut butter cups and just enjoy eating them. Fortunately this is a 2 cup packages, because my way of eating Reese\\'s Peanut Butter Cups is to eat them all. Open up a wrapper with four cups, I eat four. Open up a wrapper with two cups, I eat two. You do not want to enjoy too much of a good thing when it comes to candy.\\n',\n",

Many people have not tasted a real good cup of tea.  Good tea does not come in a 200 count per cardboard box - the tea should have higher quality and shouldn't be in a cheap cardboard box at all.  It should be in a sealed tin or packed in an airtight bag in order to preserve the flavor, and the leaves should be specially selected.  The cheapest teas are bought in bulk from the lowest quality teas parts of the tea leaf.  Yes, cost does matter in tea, just like coffee.<br /><br />Unless you're really lazy (which, I admit, I am), teas should also never, ever, be served from a bag.  Teas should be in loose form, not confined in a bag.  Why?  Because tea leaves need to expand in the water to release their full flavor.  You can buy loose tea leaves buy on amazon, high end grocery store, or in specially markets (e.g. Cost Plus), or tea shoppes.<br /><br />Now, unless you want to brew a whole pot with tea leaves in the plot, there are not many ways to make tea right for just one person.  This mug solve the single serving dilemma.  It's big, sturdy, and made of glass.  The most important thing though is that it comes with an infuser.  It looks like a cylindrical filter that is placed into the mug.  Just spoon a bit of the tea into the filter, dunk in the mug, and the tea will be brewed right then and there.  The result is some of the best tea you'll have ever drank.  The brewing is really easy, add tea to the filter, and add sub boiling hot water, wait, remove the infuser, and drink.  If you need to add sugar or cream, well, that's your choice, but I believe the right tea needs none of that.<br /><br />To make tea, place one to two spoonfuls in the filter, then pour in 160 degree water for green, steeped for a little less than 2 minutes, 180 degrees for white tea, steeped for over 5 minutes, and about 200 degrees for black or oolong, steeped for about three to four minutes.  No - you don't have to measure the temperature each time, only when first starting out.  Just bring the water to boiling, then let it cool down  until the desired temperature is reached.  Count those seconds.  Next time you make tea, boil, wait for those amount of seconds and then pour in the mug.  Easy.<br /><br />I suggest trying different teas (without adding anything), until you find your right one.  My personal favorite is Green Well Green Tea, but I still have a lot to try.<br /><br />Tea is like wine, cheese, coffee, or beer.  Quality and tastes vary tremendously, and if you only try the cheap stuff, you'll never really enjoy it like you should.\\n\",\n",

I let it set for however long I want, then reheat in the glass as appropriate, and enjoy.<br /><br />My only concern is that the infuser would be nice if it had a plunger mechanism.  I just press the herbs with a spoon to get the full flavor.  Also, the mug does not hold heat, and I usually like my infusion boiling hot!<br /><br />All in all, this is a great product, which I anticipate much use out of.\\n',\n",

The biggest secret with this tea once given to Earl Grey of Hoswick Hall (British Prime Minister in 1830 - 1834) by a Chinese manadarin, reportedly in gratitude after the earl saved his life, is to get just the right doseage of bergamot oil, a rather intense, tangy scent derived from the bergamot orange (which in turn is a cross between the pear lemon and the sour orange; the latter is native to South Vietnam, and its oil was probably the recipe\\'s original ingredient).

When guests inquired about it, they were directed to Twinings on the Strand, where they would ask for Earl Grey\\'s tea by name.\")<br /><br />Unless you insist on having *all* your tea with cream or milk, I recommend having this one without any kind of milk products: not only does the original recipe not call for such an addition; in my mind it just plain ruins the blend\\'s particular flavor. (But that\\'s just me, of course.) Whichever way you have it, though, if scented teas are your kind of thing, Twinings Earl Grey should be right up your alley.\\n',\n",
              " 'Gunpowder tea is green tea, most of which comes from a city named Pingshui in the Eastern Chinese province of Zhejiang, south of the Yangtse River Delta, where it has been cultivated for centuries and is known as the \"green pearl\" of tea. Pingshui tea market records date as far back as the Tang Dynasty (AD 618 - 907). The area\\'s gunpowder tea was an important tribute traditionally given to the Chinese emperors; and with the growing trade volume between China and the West it also acquired an increasing number of lovers in Europe. Particularly during the second half of the 19th century, when gunpowder tea export reached its peak, its price on the London market was second only to then-popular Wu Yi Oolong (also from China). Even today, Zhejiang Province still proudly calls itself \"home of silk and tea\" for its two primary natural products.<br /><br />The name \"gunpowder\" derives from the tea\\'s elaborate method of processing, which traditionally lasts several hours and during which the tea leaves are withered, steamed or stir-fried and individually rolled into small pellets. Early foreign traders mistook these pellets for gunpowder or gunshot.<br /><br />Gunpowder tea has a delicate aroma with a slightly smokey note. It should *always* be enjoyed without milk or cream.\\n',\n",
              " 'Mate is actually not tea but a tea-like beverage originating from Argentina and Uruguay, and primarily consumed in those countries as well as in Paraguay and southern Brazil; brewed from the dried leaves and stemlets of the perennial Yerba Mate tree. Its name derives from the quichua word \"mati\" designating the gourd in which it is traditionally served.  On average, 300,000 tons of Mate are produced each year.<br /><br />In its consistency similar to green tea, mate has a distinctive, full, bittersweet flavor with a note of alfalfa, resembling that of tea but milder. Of the 196 volatile chemical compounds contained in Yerba Mate, 144 are also contained in tea.  Knowing its manifold health benefits - among the plant\\'s ingredients are the alkaloids xanthine, theophylline and theobromine as well as vitamins C, E, several B vitamins and numerous minerals - the South American Guarani Indians have traditionally used the plant for medicinal purposes, inter alia as a stimulant to the central nervous system, to promote mental, physical and cardiovascular activity, enhance resistance to fatigue, reduce fever, mitigate thirst and hunger, decrease blood pressure, and as a diuretic, laxative, purgative, sudorific, and antirheumatic.<br /><br />Legend has it that knowledge of the infusion\\'s powers was first imparted to a young Guarani woman and her father by a mysterious shaman, rewarding the woman\\'s faithfulness in staying with her exhausted father while her tribe continued their search for arable land.  In recent years, mate has become a cultural phenomenon throughout large parts of South America, and it is now gaining increased popularity in Northern America and Europe as well.  In South America, sharing mate from the same container and the same straw (bombilla) is a symbol of closeness and friendship, both in a family and in other social contexts.\\n',\n",

              " 'It was in the 1920s that the H.B. Reese Candy Company first began manufacturing a product made with specially processed peanut butter and Hershey\\'s milk chocolate. Back then the product was simply known as peanut butter cups, but today the popular candy is known as Reese\\'s Peanut Butter Cups. Harry Burnett Reese was actually a former dairy employee of Milton S. Hershey, the founder of the Hershey Foods Corporation who was inspired by the example and went off to make his own fortune in the candy industry. Reese made a lot of other products, such as Johnny Bars (caramel-like molasses) and Lizzie Bars (coconut candy), but in the end his fortune was made by this single product, which offered a simple combination of peanut butter and chocolate.<br /><br />In the 1920s, from a factory located down the street from that of Hershey, Reese began selling his peanut butter cups in 5 lb. boxes to be used in candy assortments. In the 1930s he added the cups, which were originally sold for a penny each. During World War II Reese discontinued all his other products and just made the peanut butter cups, which were distributed through wholesale jobbers, vending machine operators and syndicated stores. After World War II the peanut butter cups, now in their familiar orange, yellow and brown wrapping, continued to gain national popularity. In 1963 the H.B. Reese Candy Company, Inc., was sold for $23.5 million to the Hershey Chocolate Company, and in 1976 the first variation in the Reese\\'s Peanut Butter Cup was made with the introduction of Reese\\'s Crunchy Peanut Butter Cup.<br /><br />In 1992 Reese\\'s started selling its own peanut butter in a jar, in 1994 it offered Reese\\'s bits for baking, and in 1998 the company launched ReeseSticks to go along with the Fastbreak, Nutrageous, and Bites, not to mention peanut butter Christmas trees, pumpkins, eggs, and all the other seasonal products. Now even have White Chocolate Reese\\'s Peanut Butter Cups, which pretty much defines heaven on earth for me in terms of candy making. But behind this growing array of candy products there remains the original Reese\\'s Peanut Butter Cup. There is something to be said for the simple combination of peanut butter and chocolate, as immortalized in the \"you got chocolate in my peanut butter/you got peanut butter in my chocolate\" ad campaign that inspired many Americans to walk around eating peanut butter out of a jar.<br /><br />Now, you can certainly make your own peanut butter cups. You just need 12 paper muffin cups, a 12-ounce package of milk chocolate chips, a cup of reduced-fat peanut butter, 1/2 cup of powdered sugar, a 1/4 of a teaspoon of salt, a pair of scissors, microwave, and refrigerator. But it will take you a couple of hours to make 12 candies. Or you can buy this 6 pack of peanut butter cups and just enjoy eating them without resorting to making them.\\n',\n",
              " 'I had seen this cat litter at a kiosk at the Pet Expo in Del Mar, CA and had noticed how wonderful it smells. The litter is composed of smooth, compressed and extruded pine sawdust pellets, shaped like miniature broken dowel rods. The sawdust is a by-product of the lumber industry, which must be convenient for the Florida company that produces Feline Pine, because pine trees grow like weeds in the South.<br /><br />I tried a bag to replace the ordinary silica clay cat litter we had been using for our little cat. It is not quite as absorbent or as fast-drying as clay litter; however, there is far, far less tracking and the sharp odor of ammonia is much less than that with the clay litter. Any \"dust\" that the pine pellets might have is not at all noticeable, and my little cat adjusted to using it without a problem.<br /><br />As the pellets absorb moisture, they swell and disintegrate into fine, soft sawdust. I suspect my little cat prefers the smooth texture of the pellets and the softness of the sawdust to the old small, hard, sharp clay gravel that got stuck in her paws. The sawdust does not dry as quickly as clay litter, even with daily \"stirring\", but the woodsy, evergreen fragrance of pine makes scooping much less of a chore.<br /><br />The only drawback to this litter is that the pellets are a bigger than clay litter gravel, requiring a wide-slot scooping tool so you don\\'t dump a clump of pellets into the toilet when you scoop solid waste. The bag is attractive and resealable plastic, but I think paper packaging with a clear window to see the product would entice cat owners to switch. The packaging also says \"CHEMICAL FREE...\" which is false; our planet is composed of chemicals. H2O (water) is a chemical. It should read \"HAZARDOUS CHEMICAL FREE\" or \"BIOTOXIN FREE\".<br /><br />Anyway, I\\'ll be using the old clay litter only to clean up the oil stains in my carport. Now that I\\'ve tried a premium litter, I\\'ll experiment with the wheat and corn types to find which one my little cat likes best.\\n',\n",

Twinings English Breakfast is a blend of Ceylon, Kenyan, and Indian teas with a crisp, full-bodied flavor that isn\\'t heavy or bitter. It\\'s a great tea for any time of the day and with any accompaniment, on its own, or with sugar or cream.<br /><br />Twinings employs the carbon dioxide method of decaffeination for their decaf teas. The tea is exposed to compressed carbon dioxide, which acts as a solvent, extracting the caffeine while leaving larger molecules unaffected. The process preserves more flavor and removes more caffeine than water process decaffeination. 97% of caffeine must be eliminated for a beverage to be called \"decaffeinated\", which would leave only a few milligrams of caffeine per cup of tea, regardless of the method.<br /><br />For a departure from plain tea, these are my favorite recipes:<br /><br />*Homemade Mint Tea*<br />This is wonderful consumed hot and incomparable served over ice in the summer: Bring about 3 quarts of water, 2 English Breakfast Decaffeinated tea bags (remove the string), 1/4 cup of sugar, and a handful of sliced fresh mint leaves to a boil in a saucepan.

It will keep a few days in the refrigerator.<br /><br />*Lemongrass Tea*<br />This has a smooth, mellow lemon flavor without the acidity of lemon tea: Bring about 3 quarts water, 2 English Breakfast Decaffeinated tea bags (remove the string), 1/3 cup powdered sugar cane juice (Sucanat, Florida Crystals, or substitute sugar), and half a stalk of lemongrass, thickly sliced, to a boil in a saucepan.

I kept debating between the Senseo and the HomeCafe.  It was a demo of the senseo that made me decide to go with it.  The Senseo brews a nice small cup of coffee that is nice and frothy.  It gives you the sensation of a cappuccino or latte after adding a little milk.  I adore the mild roast and the decaf roast.  I finally can have a great tasting cup of coffee whenever I want it!  It's perfect if you're a college student!\\n\",\n",
              " 'This coffee is great!  The Senseo machine can be difficult to use as far as getting pods into it correctly.  I am not sure what has happened to the people reporting \"steam locks\" but I have had issues when:<br /><br />  - the pod is not inserted properly<br /><br />  - the pod holder is not seated correctly within the machine<br /><br />  - the pod is not prepared for insertion properly<br /><br />My issues were varied, but basically consisted of hot water  coming out of the sides of the coffee maker and no coffee would be brewed, and the pod would have to be discarded.  This happened to me with Senseo pods, and probably would have happened with the Aloha Island pods except that I learned how to deal with the machine.<br /><br />Also in some of these cases the lid to the coffee maker would be stuck, (possibly the dreaded \"steam lock\"), but I was always able to open the machine after a minute or so of wiggling the lock/release handle on the machine, which I would think most people would do automatically when the machine doesn\\'t open.<br /><br />By properly preparing the pod for insertion I am able to use single pods for the Melitta One in my Senseo as well as the Aloha Island pods and of course the Senseo pods.  If you don\\'t put it in just right, you will have problems.  The key is to spread the coffee equally around within the Pod before inserting it into the machine.  Do this by wiggling the pod around a bit (take about 5 seconds).  The helpful instructions with the Aloha Island pods say to \"break up the coffee\" within the pod before using, which has the same effect.  It took me five months to figure this out while using the Senseo pods, especially when brewing two cups.  I wish Senseo would have included a little note like Aloha Island did.<br /><br />During shipping the coffee can settle or collect within the pod, either on a side(s) or even in the middle.  This changes the thickness of the pod, ever so slightly, and the machines tolerance for different thickness pods appears to be extremely low!<br /><br />So smooth out your pods and enjoy, I think that any problems you have with pods are really problems with the design of the machine, not the pods themselves.\\n',\n",

              " 'In 1923 the Milky Way bar was created with the idea of putting \"A chocolate malted milk in a candy bar\".  The original Milky Way bar was created in both chocolate and vanilla flavors, even though the latter had a dark bittersweet chocolate coating.  The name was trademarked in 1925 and sold nationally the following year for 5 cents.  In 1932 the 5-cent bar was increased to a two-piece bar and then in 1936 it went back to being a one-piece bar and the vanilla Milky Way bar was changed to the Forever Yours bar.  If you were wondering why you do not remember the Forever Yours bar that was because it was discontinued in 1979, so I would strongly advise against eating any Forever Yours bars that you might happen to find.  However, in 1989 they came out with the Milky Way Dark bar, which basically had the same ingredients as the Forever Yours bar, but you should not eat any of those either because in 2000 the Milky Way Dark Bar was renamed the Milky Way Midnight bar, because the name change along was seen as a way of increasing sales, so those you can safely eat.  Outside of the United States if you want a Milky Way bar then you just gets a Mars bar.<br /><br />A Milky Way bar is made of chocolate malt-flavored nougat and caramel covered with milk chocolate.  The nougat part is made by whipping egg whites with other ingredients until light and frothy enough to make a frappe.  That is when the cocoa and malt flavorings are added to the frappe to create the candy bar\\'s signature flavor.  As for the wiggly lines on the bottom of the bars, those come from the belt they ride on while cooling.  In 1999, in case you did not notice it, the Milky Way brand was reformulated and relaunched.  The year before they made over 200 million single size Milky Way bars produced in the United States, so they decided to change everything, from the packaging, slogan, and advertising (\"Milk it!\") to the taste.  The Milky Way bar saw a 20% increase in the caramel and the chocolate was made chunkier (however the Milky Way Dark bar that is now the Milky Way Midnight bar had its caramel increased by only 10%).  Today the slogan for Milky Way is \"Pleasure you can\\'t measure.\"<br /><br />The ingredients in a Milky Way bar are milk chocolate (sugar, cocoa butter, skim milk, chocolate, lactose, milk fat, soy lecithin, artificial flavor), corn syrup, sugar, partially hydrogenated soybean oil, skim milk, less than 2% milk fat, cocoa powder processed with alkali, lactose, malted barley, wheat flour, salt, egg whites, artificial flavor.  Each Milky Way bar is 2.05 oz (58.12 g) and has 270 calories, of which 90 are calories from fat (which is not as bad as it sounds).  The product is gluten free but is only kosher certified in the Celebrations package.  The key thing here is the taste, which combines milk chocolate with creamy caramel and fluffy nougat into a pretty sweet tasting candy bar.\\n',\n",

I even know people who eat it as a spread on white bread. It is also delicious by itself, though one cannot eat all that much of it in one sitting as it is so sweet.

              " \"I really do like my Senseo coffee maker.  I, like others who have reviewed the Kona Pods here, was always searching for a better tasting coffee pod to use in the machine. I was excited to see that Kona now made pods and was also happy to see that they had a pod that was a '2 cup style'.  I have not found it to be a huge deal to use 2 smaller '1 cup' size pods, but it sounded nice to be able to just put one large pod in the machine instead of 2 smaller one.<br /><br />After reading some of the reviews here, I could not figure out what some of the reviewers meant by the Kona pods making different amount of coffee per cup each time or how the coffee could be strange and undrinkable.  It just didn't make sense.  Well, it still doesn't make sense, but it certainly happened with the coffee I made using the Kona pods also.<br /><br />My results were overall poor and it was very disappointing as the Kona pods cost a lot more than Folgers or other pod brands that I can buy locally. The first thing I noticed was that the coffee in the 2 cup sized Kona pods is packed in much more tightly than in any other pod I have ever used in my Senseo.  The instructions for the Kona pods say to wiggle the pods to break up the coffee before inserting into the machine.  The Kona pods feel very hard when taken out of their package.  I always  wiggled and jiggled the pods for about 10 seconds before putting them in the Senseo. After my problems with the Kona pods, my husband decided that I was not 'wiggling' them enough.  He promptly wiggled one to the point that it broke open.  So, there is just so much that can be done to the pod before putting it in the machine.<br /><br />The first thing that I noticed was that the amount of coffee brewed when using the Kona pod was quite a bit less than when using 2 smaller pods.  That did not make much sense, but after several cups of Kona, it was obvious that there was never the amount of coffee coming out as before when using 2 small one cup pods.  The best I can figure out is that the Kona pods themselves seem to 'hold' a lot more water.  There is more water that remains in the pod itself after the brewing is done.  The pod itself is heavier when I take it out to throw it away.  So, I believe the reason that there is less actual coffee using Kona pods is that the pods themselves retain a lot more water and it cannot pass through into the coffee cup.<br /><br />Then, as others have mentioned, there is the problem that happens to me about 1/2 the time when using the Kona pods.  The problem is that for whatever reason, the water does not actually go through and penetrate the Kona pods during the brewing cycle. The 'coffee' that is supposed to be coming out of the spout is just water!  This problem is one that I still cannot really figure out.  The Kona pods are a little smaller in diameter than all the other pods I have tried.  So, I guess that somehow the water has enough room to 'go around' the actual pod and come out of the spout without 'going through' the pod to brew coffee.  I also wonder if the paper filter of the Kona pods is different than other pods and for some reason the Kona paper is more difficult for water to penetrate.  I have tried wetting the Kona pod paper filter right before starting to brew the coffee thinking that perhaps it would help the water to penetrate the paper and pod.  But, that has not worked for me.<br /><br />So, it is back to regular more reasonably priced coffee pods for me.  I have wasted too many expensive Kona pods trying to get a proper cup of coffee from them. Even when the Kona pods brew a cup of coffee, it is not as large of an amount of coffee as I get using other brands.  So, adding the cost of the Kona pods to the fact that it brews a smaller amount of coffee equals a product that is way too expensive when it does actually work.<br /><br />I have been reading of a product called an EcoPod.  It is a refillable pod for these type of coffeemakers.  It might be the next thing I try.\\n\",\n",

Kimbo Gold is genuine espresso from Napels, famed for its incomparable coffee, and uses only the best Brazillian coffee beans.  Its taste can be best described as potent with a real kick, but without any bitterness, and with a deep yet clear espresso flavour.  I prefer it to some of the better known premium brands, such as the otherwise excellent Illy caffe. Its flavour is much richer and isn't even lost in a capuccino or latte - the milk if anything seems to bring out the flavour even more.  I highly recommend this espresso to anyone who is looking for the real thing.\\n\",\n",

Adagio is one of the best brands I've tried and its prices are better than average for tea of this quality.<br /><br />Yunnan Gold is Adagio's premium grade Yunnan tea.  Its lower grade, Yunnan Jig, is quite good and very inexpensive, but Yunnan gold is fantastic.  It is an assertive tea, able to stand up nicely to milk and sugar, but it isn't the slightest bit bitter.  I have had it black and it was still tasty, but I prefer to have black teas light and sweet.  Even when I have accidentally over-steeped it (you should steep it for about 3 minutes), it was smooth and mellow.  There is a natural sweetness to this tea and very complex flavors that are spicy yet subtle.<br /><br />FYI, this is considered a black tea.  Black teas are so named, based upon how long they are allowed to ferment.  Green tea has the least fermentation, oolong has some fermentation, and black teas are allowed to reach complete fermentation.  Generally speaking the more a tea is fermented the more caffiene it contains.<br /><br />This is a perfect all day tea.  A pleasure first thing in the morning, and yet delightful all day and into the night (it has caffiene so if you have insomnia avoid drinking it and all caffiene beverages after 4 PM).  If you like bold tea, like a hearty Assam or Cylon, this tea might be too delicate for you, although I still suggest you give it a try, you might be seduced by its many virtues.\\n\",\n",

And yet despite amorous flirtations with rare white teas and other wondrous Indian and Chinese estate varieties with unpronounceable names, it\\'s still my favourite.<br /><br />Never mind the tea purist snobs who rank on it because it\\'s flavored with spice. Would they send back a fine filet because the chef elected to use some pepper or shallots? Ignore the herbal tea-totalers who regard caffeine as sinful. They probably want to outlaw yoga on Sunday too.<br /><br />Of the five or so Kousmichoff varieties I\\'ve had, this one is the clear winner. I\\'ve gotten my best results using HOT water steeping for five to six minutes. The stuff is potent enough that you can get, gasp, a reasonably tannin-free second infusion.<br /><br />My only reservation is this; once you\\'ve entered the universe of fine tea, you can never be satisfied drinking Lipton, Salada, Twinings or Tetley again. In guise of gifts, I have managed to get many of my gastronome friends and relations addicted so that I may sup of it when I visit. Isn\\'t it a delicious irony that perhaps the greatest bourgeoisie decadence of the Romanoff dynasty is  today preserved by our friends in socialist France?

If you have never tried this before, it is like a honey of creamed chestnuts. Even that description does not do it justice. Perhaps try to imagine a cross between Nutella and honey, but with no hint of chocolate. It spreads easily over breads, though I highly recommend you try it on something that is not coarse like American toast and not too sweet like a muffin. Let the flavor of the spread speak for itself by trying it on a sweet roll, brioche, or similarly basic bread. It is difficult to find in the United States, so I am delighted that Amazon sells a variety of Creme de Marrons.<br /><br />The container itself is good, resisting cracks or damage during daily wear and tear.

OF course, the proof is in the taste, and Boylan delivers here too. While it has a moderate head of foam, the taste is dryer than the more popular root beers, and seems more authentic.  Another reviewer commented on the cane sugar sweetening, which also imparts a less syrupy taste and texture than corn syrup; I concur.<br /><br />The root beer has a fresh, clean taste, that seems to cut through lingering food flavors. It\\'s a very satisfying, and truer tasting drink than the diluted \"hint\" of root beer offered elsewhere.  There is a distinct peppery aftertaste which is only partially moderated by ice; I enjoyed this  although it took a while to get used to.  (This taste may be due to the yucca extract.)  ALl together, this is both a thirst quencher as well as a unique \"brew\" that can be sipped slowly for the utmost enjoyment.<br /><br />Root beer was invented in 1875 by Mr. Hires (the name may be familiar to you), although precursors were available many years earlier.

That aroma is created during the tea\\'s smoking process, which involves the withering of the tea leaves in bamboo baskets hung on racks over cypress or pine wood fires, after they have been rolled and placed into wooden barrels until they emit their own aroma. The finished tea leaves are characteristically thick and black. Legend has it that this smoking process was discovered by accident during the Quing Dynasty (1644 - 1911), when an army unit camping out in a tea factory interrupted the processing of the recently-arrived leaves and the workers then resulted to drying the leaves over pine fires to make up for the disruption and get to the market in time, creating an instant sensation there.<br /><br />Because of its potent aroma, Lapsang Souchong should not steep very long.

Pingshui tea market records date as far back as the Tang Dynasty (AD 618 - 907). The area\\'s gunpowder tea was an important tribute traditionally given to the Chinese emperors; and with the growing trade volume between China and the West it also acquired an increasing number of lovers in Europe. Particularly during the second half of the 19th century, when gunpowder tea export reached its peak, its price on the London market was second only to then-popular Wu Yi Oolong (also from China). Even today, Zhejiang Province still proudly calls itself \"home of silk and tea\" for its two primary natural products.<br /><br />The name \"gunpowder\" derives from the tea\\'s elaborate method of processing, which traditionally lasts several hours and during which the tea leaves are withered, steamed or stir-fried and individually rolled into small pellets. Early foreign traders mistook these pellets for gunpowder or gunshot.<br /><br />Gunpowder tea has a delicate aroma with a slightly smokey note. It should *always* be enjoyed without milk or cream.\\n',\n",

The mountain-encased and until recently not easily accessible province is probably the location of the mythical Shangri-La, referred to in James Milton\\'s \"Lost Horizons,\" as well as home to the ancient city of Lijang (a UNESCO world heritage site) in the shadow of the mighty Yulong (Jade Dragon) Snow Mountain, Bai horses, Dali marble and numerous medicinal products, including one of China\\'s famous \"wonder drugs,\" the white powder known as \"Baibao Dan\" (One Hundred Treasures Drug), which is said to cure everything from injuries to certain gynecological diseases, and frequently applied to clean open wounds and stop bleeding, stimulate blood circulation, and against inflammations.<br /><br />Tea plantation in Yunnan began about 1700 years ago, during the Sung Dynasty (AD 960 - 1279), when the city of Pu\\'erh in the South of the province became a major tea trading center; although at least in Yunnan\\'s northwestern corner the tradition is probably even older and was imported across the border from Tibet during the Tang dynasty. Elsewhere, bricks of Pu-erh tea also constituted the first medium of monetary exchange used by nomads beyond the Great Wall of China, and their use has been recorded as early as A.D. 476.<br /><br />Yunnan is a broadleaf tea with a distinctly bright color and intense, lasting, slightly peppery or spicy taste.

These are shells, not macaroni.<br /><br />Point number one is very important. Not just because the cheese is organic (organic pastuerized milk, salt, enzymes), although that is very important to some people. No, it is mentioned here because some purists will eat only YELLOW cheddar cheese. White cheddar cheese makes white cheddar cheese sauce, and together they make something to eat with the color of white cheddar cheese. Therefore, this will look white--not snow white--but a soft creamy white, and some people (who will not be mentioned here) insist on yellow. Often this is a bright, unrealistic looking yellow, almost like it\\'s radioactive, but I am not one to judge.<br /><br />The second thing to know is that the noodle-like things covered with the white cheddar cheese sauce are NOT macaroni. (As in \"stuck a feather in his hat and called it...\") These are \"shells.\" They resemble some sea shells, like the kind that Pagoo the hermit climbed into in that book, or like the rounded shells--only smaller--that you can put up to your ear and supposedly you can then hear almost anything, like even something happening in New York or France. Again, these are not macaroni, and this is important because there are some people who will eat only the little tubes known as macaroni.<br /><br />If you are OK with this, then you\\'re in luck, and you don\\'t need to look any further for a good lunch, dinner, or after play snack (or school, if you go to school). Annie\\'s is like that other big company\\'s product (Annie\\'s is number two), where you boil and drain the macaroni (although here we have shells, NOT macaroni), and then mix in the dry sauce, maybe adding some milk or butter. \"Season to taste.\"<br /><br />The actual, official, ingredients include the following:<br />Organic Durum Semolina Pasta (Organic Durum Semolina, Water), Organic White Cheddar Cheese (Organic Cultured Pasteurized Milk, Salt, Enzymes), Whey, Salt.

              " 'All successful actors have a role or a film that defines them for the rest of their careers. Tom Cruise has \"Risky Business.\" Robert De Niro has \"Taxi Driver.\" Marlon Brando had a lot of them, including \"On the Waterfront,\" \"The Godfather,\" and \"Apocalypse Now.\" Who can watch Jimmy Stewart and not think of \"It\\'s a Wonderful Life\"? See what I mean? The list could on and on indefinitely. The lesser known actors, while not as visible to the majority of moviegoers, are critical to the success of Hollywood because they often take supporting roles that make the leads look good. They are recognizable faces to niche film fans, however. Enter Clint Howard, brother of the better known director and actor Ron Howard. Horror movie fans will forever pay homage to Clint--he of the perpetually balding pate, goofy visage, and lumbering gait--for his seminal role of Stanley Coopersmith in the 1982 gorefest \"Evilspeak.\" They will just as likely hold a grudge against him for appearing in Uwe Boll\\'s atrocious \"House of the Dead,\" but that\\'s another story for another time. Clint has appeared in dozens of films, as well as most of the films lensed by his brother, but \"Evilspeak\" is his defining moment.<br /><br />\"Evilspeak\" opens in the distant past by showing a group of Spaniards excommunicating Esteban (Richard Moll) and his followers from the Church for blasphemous activities. What sorts of activities? The movie doesn\\'t spend much time explaining what these folks are doing, but we do see Esteban performing some sort of bizarre ritual on the beach immediately before sacrificing a young lady to his dark deities. Flash forward to the present--meaning 1981 or 1982--to a soccer game at the West Andover Military Academy. Stanley Coopersmith (Howard) trips at a critical moment and loses the game for the team. The abuse heaped upon this poor lad is extreme. Coach (Claude Earl Jones) initially sticks up for Coopersmith by telling his teammates that every boy at the academy gets a shot at playing for the school. Within seconds of this exclamation, the coach helpfully makes a \"suggestion\" to Bubba (Don Stark) and his pals that if an injury sidelined Stanley, there wouldn\\'t be much anyone could do about it. Wow, what a bunch of jerks! This is only the beginning, however, as we soon learn that the entire school seems to have it in for this poor kid. Colonel Kincaid (Charles Tyner), the commandant of the academy, can\\'t stand him either. Neither can Reverend Jameson (Joseph Cortese) or the alcoholic caretaker Sarge (R.G. Armstrong).<br /><br />Things start to look up for Coopersmith when he discovers a labyrinth of corridors underneath the school. Wouldn\\'t you just know it? It turns out that the academy sits on the very site where Esteban and his followers established a church devoted to Satan. Stanley\\'s discovery is in actuality Esteban\\'s old haunt. Our hero finds a book written in Latin containing many conjurations and dark prayers, and it isn\\'t too long before he\\'s entering all of this stuff into his computer in an effort to discover what it means. Meanwhile, the torment continues. Bubba and his fellow goons destroy Stanley\\'s class project, and physically assault him in the corridors every chance they get. Kincaid administers a whipping, and Jameson can barely look at the boy without cringing. Coopersmith\\'s dark discoveries soon take on a vengeful tone as he begins actively collecting the necessary materials to cast a spell against his tormenters. The final straw occurs when Bubba and his friends perform an act so despicable against the only thing Coopersmith cares about in the entire world. From this point forward the gloves are off as \"Evilspeak\" turns into an unmitigated gorefest of epic proportions. Note to self: never pick on anyone again. EVER.<br /><br />\"Evilspeak\" never lets us forget that Clint Howard is the star of the film. The camera rarely leaves him, which is a good thing because we see what a fine actor he is. Howard gives his put upon character great depth, makes us believe totally that he\\'s a rather inept kid with a penchant for clumsiness yet deep inside is a good guy just looking to improve his lot in life. Stanley Coopersmith is so harassed that you can\\'t help but root for him. Perhaps I should compliment the other actors at this point as well because they come across as the most unlikable bunch of cretins in B movie history, and that is exactly what the script called for them to do. I cheered at the end as Coopersmith took gory revenge against his oppressors. Speaking of the gore, \"Evilspeak\" contains several scenes of carnage and general mayhem rarely witnessed in American horror films. The pigs paying a visit to the secretary at her home should win some sort of award, but the real gooey stuff appears at the end. Imagine an airborne Clint Howard in devilish makeup slicing through heads and limbs with an enormous sword. Yep, it\\'s gory, it\\'s gluey, and it\\'s great.<br /><br />A huge thanks goes out to Anchor Bay for releasing such a fine DVD version of the film. Extras include a commentary with Howard and director Eric Weston, poster stills, and a trailer. The commentary is a lot of fun due to Clint Howard\\'s observations. He tells lots of great stories, including one about some problems he encountered with law enforcement when he wore his military uniform from the film to a Las Vegas casino several years later. Clint seems like a great guy and his enthusiasm for the film appears genuine. Weston and Howard even discuss the idea of making a sequel! It probably won\\'t happen, but if it matches this film in the gore department I\\'ll be the first one in line to see it.\\n',\n",

If your supermarket carries it, it should be about half that -- you don't have to pay shipping you lucky dog!\\n\",\n",

Throw in some bizarre concepts and characters, add humor and cool old school special effects, top it all off with an outstanding wacky performance by Michael Keaton and you might begin to understand why it works. This movie is just so much fun to watch mainly because it combines so many genres and to this day it remains one of the most unique takes on a ghost story.<br /><br />I have the old 1997 (were DVDs around then?) DVD release and the picture and sound isn't that great. This Blu-ray is like a whole new experience in terms of video and audio quality.

I can't speak for its authenticity since I'm not Jamaican, and my one and only trip to Jamaica was years ago.  Considering how I see this brand being sold in more stores and in higher quantities than any other brand I think its probably as close as you're going to get.  I love the sauce, and I always make sure I have an extra bottle on hand at all times in case I run out.\\n\",\n",

Unless you can't handle ANY heat, don't bother.<br /><br />I did make one decent dish with this sauce.

              " 'I used to make a Mocha Caf&eacute; au Lait on the stove with milk, melted chocolate, coffee, sugar, and seasonings. It was a delicious flavorful alternative to equally delicious homemade hot cocoa for special occasions. I have never been satisfied with easy or \"instant\" methods of making plain hot cocoa. They just can\\'t compete with the richness of heavy cream and melted chocolate. But my Mocha Caf&eacute; au Lait met its match in Ghirardelli\\'s Chocolate Mocha. This is a wonderful powdered mix of chocolate, vanilla, and coffee.<br /><br />The instructions tell you to mix 3 tablespoons of Ghirardelli\\'s Chocolate Mocha with 8 oz (1 cup) of milk, heat, and serve. I find that 2 tablespoons with 2/3 cup of milk fills the average cup or mug. And I always use half-and-half instead of milk. Topped with sweetened whipped cream, this makes a decadent, filling dessert that rivals homemade and restaurant beverages and is attractive enough to serve to guests. Serve with a spoon for those who like to eat the whipped cream before it all melts into the chocolate.<br /><br />Ghirardelli provides microwave and stovetop directions. The microwave instructions advise heating the milk for 1-1 1/2 minutes before adding the Chocolate Mocha mix. I don\\'t think the 2-step process is necessary, but if you\\'ve ever tried to heat milk or half-and-half in a microwave, you know how quickly it can get out of hand. One second nothing is happening; the next second the milk has bubbled all over the floor of your oven, leaving little in the cup. If you want to heat the hot chocolate in the microwave, you can add the Chocolate Mocha mix before you heat the milk, but don\\'t take your eyes off of it once you start heating. If you see any bubbles, stop the microwave immediately, stir the drink, and heat more as necessary. Keep doing that until it\\'s hot enough for you.\\n',\n",

Oh, but the FDA does not allow it to be called a \"sweetener\" it has to be labeled a \"nutritional suppliment\" by law so that it can not compete with big money contributers Aspartame (equal) and Sucralose (splenda) and Acesulfame-K so although Stevia is safe and has been used for thousands of years in other countries (even was in Diet Coke in Japan) the only problem the FDA has, is that it can not be called a sweetener!<br /><br />Please don\\'t take my word for anything I have just said above, please do the research yourself so you KNOW it is all the truth.\\n',\n",

Whenever I\\'ve tried instant versions of oatmeal in the past I\\'ve found them entirely inedible. Thin. watery, and no texture or real oatmeal flavor.  Mcdougalls oatmeal cups are so close to the \"real\" thing there is barely any difference.  After an initial try I ordered the 6 pack of my 3 favorite flavors.  I\\'ve been really happy with my breakfast every morning of oatmeal and tea.  My only issues are the small amount of soy used and freshness.  I\\'d prefer they used something else or at least be sure the soy is organic. I did find a couple of rancid cups in the batch so they need to be sure these are fresh.

              " 'I had my heart set on making all my own baby food, so I bought this baby food maker a few months ago.  I had never made baby food before, and in hindsight I think I would have done things a little differently.  I am hoping that my experience might be helpful to someone else in determining whether he/she wants to buy the Beaba.<br /><br />First of all, the Beaba is a great little machine and very convenient.  I just prep the food, throw it in, add the water, and let it do its thing until it\\'s time to blend it up.  It\\'s nice that it\\'s all in one machine and I don\\'t have to get any other dishes dirty.  It\\'s also very reliable.  I can\\'t even tell you how many times I have used it in the last few months.  Some days I use it 5-7 times and it just chugs on.<br /><br />That said, in my opinion it has a very small capacity.  That might not matter to you and you might not even notice.  It all depends on your style and how you want to feed your baby.  So far, I have come across two styles of grinding up your own baby food:<br /><br />1)  Steaming and grinding up baby food multiple times a week, possibly before every meal.  Some people really enjoy sharing whatever they are eating with their baby.  They prep it and feed it to their baby a few minutes later.<br /><br />2)  Steaming and grinding up baby food less often, but making larger amounts of food.  Some people want to have baby food on hand all the time.  They make a large amount of food, freeze it in ice cube trays, keep it in the freezer and thaw cubes before every meal.<br /><br />I think there are advantages to both styles, but I personally veer toward making larger batches of food and freezing it so I have it on hand.  If you are like me, the Beaba isn\\'t your best option.  Get a nice Cuisinart with a larger capacity(or use the one you already have).  If you are worried about how to steam the food (I used to think I would have to do it on the stove), you can put it in a microwave safe dish with some water and steam it in the microwave.<br /><br />When I was particularly overwhelmed, a friend recommended that I get the \"Fresh Baby So Easy Baby Food Kit.\"  If you\\'re interested in making large batches of food, it can completely set you straight.  It comes with a video, a book, a handy laminated reference chart and two ice cube trays.  The video was incredibly cheesy, but it made me feel like I knew what I was doing in about 45 minutes.<br /><br />I hope this was helpful.  Good luck!\\n',\n",

This was the first and only time I have ever been to the ER for a migraine in 20+ years of getting migraines.<br /><br />Even after that incident I really wanted to continue at least with a small dose before bed. I tried this on and off for several weeks, but unfortunately it consistently aggravated my headaches the next day anytime I took it.<br /><br />I've noticed other forms of Magnesium also cause headache issues for me, which is odd since it is supposed to help prevent them.

After the first round, drain them in a colander and check the texture, do they still have water in the noodles?  If so, put them back into the microwave and zap them again.  This process removes all of the liquid, and gives the noodles an actual pasta texture and consistency.  And, it allows them to reabsorb whatever sauce you're pairing them with to give them flavor.<br /><br />Once they're ready, you can combine them with ingredients to throw in the oven for an amazing tuna casserole, or throw them into a reduced pasta sauce for an amazing dry spaghetti, or add them at the end of cooking a phad thai.\\n\",\n",

The beans were whole and fresh; that is the main reason that I am ordering from this vender again, plus they were not so expensive, although in the Chinese store it cost $2.99 for 9 ounces of cocoa beans. Still, it is a good buy if I can't find them in the local stores.<br />I would recommend those beans to anyone who has tried cocoa beans before, or, if you are new to those, why not try the best and the freshest.

              " \"What can I say? Orgain is the best protein shake I've ever had, and I've tried many of them over the years. Out of the three flavors, this newest flavor is definitely the best. I have used and continue to use Amazon's 'Subscribe & Save' option for all of the Orgain shakes, as I drink them at least four to five times per week and don't have to worry about searching for them all over town. In my area, the Whole Foods by me sells out often and generally only has the Vanilla Bean flavor in stock (my least favorite). The local health food store, hardly ever has them as well. So, I was quite happy after finding the Orgain shakes on Amazon, over a year ago.<br /><br />Nutrition wise, I can honestly say that there is definitely an increase in energy after consistently drinking these, but not in that unnatural, over stimulated way that caffeinated or chemical laden products can sometimes leave you feeling. I use them as meal replacements when pressed for time, when my appetite is light, and/or an hour before working out...for the energy boost.<br /><br />Cost wise, if you're on a tight budget, this product might be a bit of a splurge, but is still less per shake, than the average latte, or fast food meal. Which is obviously, not as healthy for you.<br /><br />Currently, I switch between drinking the Cafe Mocha and Chocolate Fudge and would highly recommend this product. For those like myself, who work in an office setting, these are a great option to keep in the work fridge, in order to steer clear of that office snacking area (the vending machine, that co-worker who loves to bake, the Friday doughnut day, etc.).\\n\",\n",

It's super easy just add water and you have prefect tangy sourdough that's very close to making it the long hard way from starter.

Very happy with this mix and will be trying some of the other Krusteaz mixes. This comes with everything including the yeast, just add water. Also the tangy flavor is better if you wait to eat 4 hours or more after baking.\\n\",\n",
              " 'These old-fashioned chocolate wafer cookies are the key ingredient in many recipes. Even Martha Stewart uses them on her show as the bottom of her Ice-cream Bon-Bons. In my family, they are used as the key ingredient in what is often called \"Ice-Box Cake\" or refrigerator cake which is layered chocolate wafers between some type of creamy filling such as sweetened marscapone cheese or cool-whip type preparation. For additional \"oomph\" you can crumble them on top of the pan of \"cake\" for decoration.  If you have any of the classic Martha Stewart Cookbooks or follow the new trends in Food Design through fancy cupcake books or Family Fun Magazine , you\\'ll fiind these wafers mentioned with great frequency as an essential ingredient.  One can also modify the basic Ice-Box cake recipe that this Wafer is famous for  and add cocoa to the whipping cream to create an inexpensive and alternative Bûche de Noël Dessert centerpiece (the traditional French Yule Log cake) for the holidays without having to bake a jelly roll cake and hope that it doesn\\'t break as you roll it up!  I admit, I\\'ve done that myself at least twice and recieved nothing but compliments.  All you have to do is add some chocolate mushrooms & some Marzipan or Fondant forest creatures  to the scene and you\\'re all set!<br /><br />These wafers are becoming harder and harder to find in grocery stores so most bakers order them by the case, as they are offered here,  since they keep well on the shelf and are so versatile. You can make simple icre-crem sandwiches with them by smoothing softened ice-cream between them or you can dress them up by then enrobing them in melted chocolate. They also jazz up any dessert as a simple decoration. In short...if you cook, bake or assemble desserts, you must have some of these in your pantry.<br /><br />The price here may seem a little steep but you are buying 12 packages which may be more than an average household will likely use in a year. However,  since these wonderful recipe basic cookie wafers are at the heart of so many family favorite desserts, I would suggest splitting an order with one other baker in your family since even the occasional baker could easily go thru 6 boxes in a year just by making a few recipes and snacking. By splitting a case order with a friend or family member, you each have what you need on hand for gatherings when an Ice-Box Cake is just the thing everyone needs to celebrate or if you are hoping to add a little ZING to a cupcake or Muffin recipe by placing one of these wafers at the bottom.  Incidentally, the Icebox Cake recipe is featured on the package and the photo show depiicts what it looks like when made in the traditional manner.  Ask around and once you mention the Ice-Box Cake, I\\'m sure you\\'ll find a baking friend  who is very willing to split a case with you!\\n',\n",

That was weeks ago, and they never bothered to respond. So I am assuming they can't back up their claim that it's truly a Himalayan pink sea salt. What's funny is, on every container of salt I've ever purchased there is an ingredients list...NOT on this one. (If it's pure, then the ingredients will obviously have only one ingredient...the salt.

There were two things that dissapointed me... Intelligenstsia has started selling smaller bags (12 oz) for the same price that they used to sell a 16 oz bag for. I didn't play close enough attention so the savings I thought I was getting (compared to where I usually buy it) was not there. Secondly the roast date on the coffee I got was a couple months old. I am used to being a week old, maybe two worst case. These bags had been setting around for awhile. I am going to stick to getting 16 oz bags from my usual merchant.\\n\",\n",

I have to say I was pleasantly surprised at the quality. With just two cups of water and a microwave safe bowl I had an instant side dish, or on late nights an actual meal. I have tried all the varieties and have liked each one. Quick and easy, perfect for the family on the go that needs to add variety to their meals. I will admit I do add a bit of pepper for a little kick to it, but many will find this perfect straight from the pouch.

They do in fact have real fruits and other things like meat products and they do have freeze-dried snacks to reduce the weight on the space shuttle. this food is extremely light weight as compared to traditional foods. On a space shuttle launch every pound costs thousands of dollars so literately every pound counts. I would see this being a good snack pack for the crew of a space shuttle on the bridge or other space craft crew or the I.S.S(International Space Station)teams. But let me explain what exactly you are supposed to get in this sampler. Two 4inchesx4inches freeze dried astronaut ice cream squares one green mint chocolate chip and the other strawberry/vanilla/chocolate combo flavor, and one freeze dried ice cream sandwich. You also should get two astronaut space food energy bars with a refrigerator magnet. One chocolate and the other peanut butter. So basically what they show in the picture is what you get in this food sampler. But if you ask me it did make me thirsty. So I would drink a good amount of water after eating this stuff. Oh and FYI the ice cream is broken up into peaces so you can eat smaller peaces of of it. So my opinion is great sampler for the money. Just have water with yours.\\n',\n",

After a bunch of looking around, I decided to try this one.<br /><br />When it came, I was shocked at the amount. For some reason I was expecting a couple handfuls, and got several dozen handfuls.

I mixed it in with the eucalyptus from the same company (and same great quality) and put that with the flax in the bag.

Yumminess!!<br />However, I most often eat a serving in a little ice cream dish with a sprinkle of ginger, nutmeg or some chia seeds or berries.<br /><br />I was just amazed at how many people find the taste lacking and amused that one person accused others of working for the company because their opinions differed from hers. I believe I know why such a wide range of opinions here:<br /><br />Depends upon the condition of your palate and sensitivity of your taste buds.<br />Some people are supertasters, other not. However there are environmental factors. The more sweet and processed foods you eat, the more dull your taste buds become, craving more sweet and processed flavors, because you've conditioned your taste buds accordingly.<br /><br />Usually, the cleaner your diet, the more sensitive your taste buds will become. I see this often with my patients who give up soda (especially diet soda), and they report having less sugar cravings from just that switch.<br /><br />Also, as people age, their taste buds also grow duller/weaker. This is why seniors often love very rich/sweet foods, because their taste buds can pick up some of the taste, whereas blander foods are harder for them to taste.<br /><br />Love Arctic Zero.

              " \"::::::UPDATED 9/8/2012:::::::: No longer fake solution being used. Real thick solution now::::::::Read below original comment.<br /><br />The 3 pack of Dove for Men Liquid Soap was opened already and was far more liquidy then the store bought brand. Normally this soap is much thicker, but the soap available on Amazon seems to have a thinner viscosity(like someone added water to it). It's like someone took 1-2 bottles and added water to them to make them fit into 3 bottles. The 3 pack I received had Skotch clear tape holding the lids on and I believe if this wasn't on the thin formula that Amazon provides of this Soap would more than likely leak out if this wasn't done. This soap isn't cheap and the 3 pack sounds like a deal, but when you get it you'll realize why. By buying it on Amazon you save some money, but your getting screwed since the soap is not the original Dove for Men formula, but instead a much more watered down version of this soap. A real disappointment!<br /><br />:::::UPDATE::: After running out of the water downed Dove for Men 3 pack I had, I decided to give Amazon one more try.  Since a year has passed and the price is amazing, I figured I'd see if the solution was still a problem and I can gladly say it's now the real thing. The Dove for Men solution they are now using is the same thick solution you can find in stores. Thanks for fixing this Amazon.\\n\",\n",

Starbucks has not previously offered flavored coffees themselves because they know it will contaminate unflavored coffee in a grinder.  They are getting around this by only selling the coffee pre-ground, therefore, no customer will ever request it to be ground.<br /><br />When first opened, the quality is decent despite being pre-ground.  However, I do find, the quality of the product slips away fairly quickly being a ground coffee.<br /><br />Furthermore, again, I am not a particular fan of flavored coffees.  If I need a sweetener or flavor, I'd prefer to add it myself.  Nevertheless, this  vanilla flavored product is not terribly unpleasant.

My only other issue is the amount of oil in the curry mix.  If you have leftovers (like I did), you'll definitely notice the oil since some of it separates out during refrigeration.  While the nutritional information here and on the box make it seem like this product isn't that decadent, the serving sized used is unrealistically small.  It's more reasonable to double the values listed, meaning that each serving of meat will have an additional 200+ calories from the sauce.

I have been trying to stay away from so much soy so I thought these bars would be a nice change of pace.  Upon opening this bar the smell was really nice.  I could smell peanuts but no chocolate smell was present.  I really loved the look of the bar, with all the seeds and such.  First bite I loved the texture, alot like the lara bars.  The taste was just so not what I expected, there wasn't any taste at all that I could even compare it to.  All I tasted to be honest was dates, no peanut butter or chocolate at all.  I was so dissapointed in this bar, I had such high hopes and expectations. I gave it two stars because the nutrition is there, but the flavor is not.  At over two bucks a bar at my local health food store, in no way is it worth it no matter how good the nutrition is.  I will get my nutrition in a more delicious form. So if I were you I would purchase one in the store before even thinking about buying this bar on amazon.

I've never seen this salt look that way before...but hey, it is entirely possible that it is truly that color without additives...so I went to the source and wrote the company to find out. That was weeks ago, and they never bothered to respond. So I am assuming they can't back up their claim that it's truly a Himalayan pink sea salt. What's funny is, on every container of salt I've ever purchased there is an ingredients list...NOT on this one. (If it's pure, then the ingredients will obviously have only one ingredient...the salt. But sometimes, even in sea salt, there is an added anti-caking agent added so it will be listed there.)

With the factory set position, the bigger gopher will be choked, while the little one will be crushed at the mid section.  The key to successfully use this trap is how to set it.  You have to think like a gopher, and construct this unit into the gopher's existing tunnel.  Then, leave a little opening a bit further down the tunnel.  Gophers' instinct will be to close the opening further down the tunnel, thus activate the trigger.  I have caught gophers 3 hours after the traps were set.  2 from 1 trap in the same day.<br /><br />If you are afraid to dig a big hole in your yard, this is not a unit for you as it requires some space to construct an elaborate trap.

In my area, the Whole Foods by me sells out often and generally only has the Vanilla Bean flavor in stock (my least favorite). The local health food store, hardly ever has them as well. So, I was quite happy after finding the Orgain shakes on Amazon, over a year ago.<br /><br />Nutrition wise, I can honestly say that there is definitely an increase in energy after consistently drinking these, but not in that unnatural, over stimulated way that caffeinated or chemical laden products can sometimes leave you feeling. I use them as meal replacements when pressed for time, when my appetite is light, and/or an hour before working out...for the energy boost.<br /><br />Cost wise, if you're on a tight budget, this product might be a bit of a splurge, but is still less per shake, than the average latte, or fast food meal.

That was weeks ago, and they never bothered to respond. So I am assuming they can't back up their claim that it's truly a Himalayan pink sea salt. What's funny is, on every container of salt I've ever purchased there is an ingredients list...NOT on this one. (If it's pure, then the ingredients will obviously have only one ingredient...the salt.

This is one of my favorite spices. Like other reviews have said, it is not extremely potent, nor is it spicy, but if you like to cook from scratch and add lots of different spices to your food, this is a great complimentary spice to almost anything. It works well in pasta sauce, chicken dishes, soup, beef, and so many other things. It is more of an herb blend than a garlic/onion blend, which is nice if you like to add fresh garlic and onions or have more potent garlic/onion powder separately. The other nice feature is that it doesn't contain any salt, so if you are looking to add additional flavor to already salty items like canned soup or a box of mac n' cheese this works great. A few of the spice blends I like to use already contain salt and the fact that I can use this spice in combination with them without creating an overly salty dish is wonderful. I do think you can use a much larger quantity of this spice than many others. I wasn't sure just how much I liked this spice until I ran out and my local market stopped carrying it.

My only complaint is that while every recipe uses numbers measured in whole eggs, the scoop provided using a 3:2 egg to water ratio ends up giving you 1 and 1/2 eggs equivalent.  It makes it a little difficult to measure, but that is a minor complaint.  If you are stocking for emergency supplies, this (claims) a very long shelf life, which I have little reason to doubt, since freeze drying is a very reliable method of preservation.  They specifically remove glucose from the eggs to avoid retardation of flavor, but I doubt most people could taste the difference.

It came in a little plastic bag. I raved to all my family and friends how great they tasted - just the right amount of salty and sweet.<br /><br />I\\'m eating some right now, not thrilled. Could just as easily be some generic brand, hardly any sweet at all. I bought this canister at a local supermarket.<br /><br />If you\\'re into reusing or recycling plastic containers there\\'s good and bad here. If you want to reuse the container you can remove the entire label and you have a tall dark green plastic containers with a screw on lid - the only marking is an impression on the top of the lid that says Emerald.<br /><br />Problem is, the top is number 5 plastic and the bottom is number 7. Number 7 is the most unhealthy and hardest to recycle plastic there is so you don\\'t want to reuse this for food and your local area might not accept it for recycling. You can use it for nuts & bolts maybe in the garage? But in my opinion it shouldn\\'t be used for these nuts, or any food. Number 7 shouldn\\'t be used at all, ever, should be illegal. Gases leach off of it and into the food and into the air.....<br /><br />I think I\\'m going to throw these out now. I got them on sale so it\\'s not too much of a waste. I just realized they use #7 plastic as I was writing this. Had I realized before, I would not have bought them. I\\'m going to pay more attention in the future when buying things in plastic jars.<br /><br />~<br /><br />Plastic #1: This is polyethylene terephtalate, also known as PETE or PET.  Most disposable soda and water bottles are made of #1 plastic, and it\\'s usually clear. This plastic is considered generally safe. However, it is known to have a porous surface that allows bacteria and flavor to accumulate, so it is best not to keep reusing these bottles as makeshift containers. This plastic is picked up by most curbside recycling programs.<br /><br />Plastic #2: This is high density polyethylene, or HDPE.  Most milk jugs, detergent bottles, juice bottles, butter tubs, and toiletries bottles are made of this.  It is usually opaque. This plastic is considered safe and has low risk of leaching. It is also picked up by most recycling programs.<br /><br />Plastic #3: This is polyvinyl chloride, or PVC. It is used to make food wrap, bottles for cooking oil, and plumbing pipes. PVC is a tough plastic but it is not considered safe to cook food near it. There are phthalates in this material-softening chemicals that interfere with hormonal development. You should minimize use of #3 plastic around food as much as possible. Never cook using food wrap, especially in a microwave oven. If the wrap is listed as microwave-safe then I would still not let it touch the food while using it in the microwave. #3 plastic is rarely accepted by recycling programs.<br /><br />Plastic #4: This is low density polyethylene (LDPE). It is used to make grocery bags, some food wraps, squeezable bottles, and bread bags. This plastic is considered safe, but is unfortunately not often accepted by curbside recycling programs.<br /><br />Plastic #5: this is polypropylene. Yogurt cups and similar wide-necked containers are often made from it, as well as water bottles with a cloudy finish. You\\'ll also find it in medicine bottles, ketchup and syrup bottles, and straws. This plastic is also considered safe, and is increasingly being accepted by curbside recycling programs.<br /><br />Plastic #6: this is polystyrene, or Styrofoam, from which disposable containers and packaging are made. You\\'ll also find it in disposable plates and cups. Evidence is increasingly suggesting that this type of plastic leaches potentially toxic chemicals, especially when heated. I suggest avoiding the use of #6 plastic as much as possible. It is difficult to recycle and most recycling programs won\\'t accept it.<br /><br />Plastic #7: This number basically means \"everything else.\" It\\'s a mixed bag, composed of plastics which were invented after 1987.  Polycarbonate falls into this category, including the dreaded BPA. So do modern plastics used in anything from iPods to computer cases. It also includes some baby bottles and food storage containers which resist staining. Use of #7 plastic is at your own risk, since you don\\'t know what could be in it. You should dispose of any food or drink related product, especially for children, that is known to contain BPA. I personally also view any other food or drink container made from #7 plastic with a good deal of suspicion. It is difficult to recycle #7 plastic and most curbside recycling programs won\\'t accept it.<br /><br />To summarize, plastics #2, #4 and #5 are generally considered safe. Plastic #1 is safe too but should not be re-used due to the risk of growing bacteria. Any other plastic should be used with extreme caution, especially around food or drink. The risk is even greater when heating food. For microwaving in particular, remember that microwave safe containers aren\\'t necessarily healthy. They just won\\'t melt. In general, it\\'s better to avoid microwaving plastic entirely and stick to glass.\\n',\n",

To send some to a friend as a gift using Amazon, with shipping costs I paid $17.92 which is $4.48/bag for four bags.<br /><br />If you want to try these peanuts, first see if you can find them in a local Asian market before you order from Amazon at the price I paid.\\n',\n",

              " 'I was at Trader Joe\\'s, randomly browsing at the deli meats section for something to munch on later when one of these individual links caught my eye. At first I thought the white on the outside was some sort of wrapping, but upon squinting I noticed that it looked like a residue.<br />\"Hm. This is weird\", I thought. Maybe I\\'ll eat it. Sorta like when you find strange crumbs on your kitchen table and stick it in your mouth when no one\\'s looking.<br />So I bought a link, and read the information about Columbus Salame Secchi. Lo and behold, it\\'s actually a sort of mold that grew on the outside of meat! Well I had already bought the thing, and figure I might as well eat it, strange as it may be.<br /><br />I was back at Trader Joe\\'s the next day.<br />They had ONE left. My entire week was ruined!<br />So I did the only thing I could do. Buy it on Amazon!!!!!<br />The package of 12 links came two days ago. Went to the nearby hippie grocery store, bought some Cabernet, Stilton cheese, and imported Italian olives.<br />Wow...<br /><br />The flavor on this meat is just... irresistible. I know when people say something is irresistible, they mean it\\'s really, really good. I actually mean this thing is impossible to resist. I always start eating a link with the intention of just having maybe a third or a half of a link, not because I\\'m a health nut or something, but just because I don\\'t want to pig out on just some salami. This isn\\'t just salami. This is Salame Secchi. Before I know it, I\\'ve eaten the whole darn link of sausage, and I\\'m feeling guilty not because I\\'ve eaten the entire thing, but because I have one fewer link left to eat later.<br /><br />The meat, mold, and fat in the salame come together in a joyful union taste-bud heaven. There\\'s nothing else quite like it. I\\'ve always been a fan of salami and prosciutto, but you NEED to try this.

I tried a couple coffee brands without milk and sugar, and this was the one that really caught my taste buds\\' attention. It\\'s very mild, borderline light-bodied, with a subtle flavor and not too bitter. It doesn\\'t taste like you\\'re chewing on beans, but it\\'s not watered down like some sub-standard brands you find in stores (I\\'m looking at you Folgers 10lbs jug of \"ground\").<br /><br />A few months later, a co-worker brought a Keurig to work and offered access to it. I purchased packs of Green Mountain Nantucket Blend the same day and enjoyed 48 cups of it, dreaming of the day I may have a Keurig at home.

              " 'I\\'ve drank the Honest brand products with mixed success.  Their lemonade left much to be desired, but this drink proved to be a little better.  And since I have a love hate relationship with pomegranate flavored things, I could be a little biased as well.  Sometimes they\\'re fantastic, some times they\\'re fairly lackluster.<br /><br />Pomegranate Blue is a flavored juice made from Pomegranates and Blueberries.  And it tastes most strongly of Pomegranates rather than the blueberries.  In fact, I didn\\'t really taste the blueberries at all.  The pomegranate too was kind of muted, and this drink tasted like a watered down version of fruit juice.  It wasn\\'t very sweet, which actually was ok because the bottle advertised that it was \"just a tad sweet\" so it lived up to that expectation.  Someone looking for a sugary kool-aid type product is probably not going to be fond of the taste of this product.<br /><br />The ingredients are healthy, which is good because that is what the Honest brand is known for.  It was a little disappointing that the juice is from concentrate, but at least its a healthier concentrate.  And a good portion of the ingredients were organic as well, which is always a plus.  The sweetener is organic cane sugar, so no nasty artificial sweeteners here.  Although I am a bit surprised that they didn\\'t go for stevia in this drink.  And for those watching their diets, there\\'s only a 100 calories in a 16.9 fl oz bottle.  For the juices, I was surprised to see that grape juice had a higher content than the pomegranate and blueberry juices, which was kind of disappointing since the name of the drink is Pomegranate Blue.<br /><br />Not a bad drink, but not one I\\'d seek out again either.  I\\'ll keep giving the Honest brand a try, and hope that I run into a flavor I like.  They have good ingredients, but not so great taste most of the time.<br /><br />Review by M.

It is lacking in flavor-just a bland, plain cake taste that was also very sweet.  The streusel part was very disappointing.  It had an odd flavor that no one in my family could figure out.

They were getting grumbly stomachs too often for my liking (about twice a week or so).  So I started looking for another food with a smaller ingredient panel and lower fat, higher fiber.  I also use canned and dry.  I remembered that I had used Mulligan Stew cans in the past and the dogs loved it and did very well on it, so I started researching the food and company to see if I felt they met my standards as a trustworthy company.  I love the science behind the food.  They don't use any synthetic vitamins/minerals and after finding out that they use no Asian sourced ingredients, the kibble is baked so it's more digestible, the ingredient panel for both kibble and canned is smaller, and the company representative Diane was a dream to work with and very knowledgable I decided to order a 5lb. bag to try (I used an amazon gift card I had).  When the bag came, I transitioned them immediately (using probiotics and enzymes to help).  It went great!  I still used the Fromm Gold canned food (until I could order in some Mulligan Stew cans) and the Mulligan Stew dry.  They ate it like candy!  I couldn't wait to see if the grumbly stomachs continued and if their stool looked okay.  Well, after about 4 days they've not had a stomach episode at all, their stool is normal, they eat it up like it's candy and my oldest Cavalier is actually acting a little more lively.  I'm sure her stomach was hurting before.  Needless to say, I'm ordering a larger order of the kibble and some cases of the canned.  Mulligan Stew seems to be the ticket for my dogs' good health.

Sadly this is another product the Newman's company has made unconsumable.  It shows that companies do not respect consumer enough to have the main or key ingredients Organic.  For example if you get Organic cinnamon, ginger, cocoa, or chocolate cookies it should be Organic... Not made from Organic Wheat while the named ingredients are non organic unknown chemicals etc.  I'll continue to use their products for my dogs until those are ruined too.

Don't leave this world without Him...<br /><br />Gift of God<br /><br />With all the bad going on in the world, God wants us to tell everyone about His good news.<br /><br />It's so fascinating always watching everything unfold just like the Bible predicts. I am often sent emails saying to forward it to everyone on my list if I am not ashamed of Yahweh (God) and His Messiah Yahushua HaMashiach (Jesus Christ). I do not forward those emails cuz I don't trust them (I'm not computer literate either), so I am sending this to everyone on my list (along with everyone else), as God does command us (no matter what the consequence to us) to share His good news with every one of His Messiah providing us with the only good way out of this world.<br /><br />Yep, just like it says it's going to happen in the Holy Bible (no matter which version is chosen to be believed or not believed), it's gonna get beyond tragically ugly here. If we think that there's been bad stuff already happening, we ain't seen nothin yet. Pretty much (if I remember correctly, but it's in the Bible), God unleashes 7 plagues the likes of which the world has never seen nor will see again (remember Sodom and Gomorrah, Noah's Ark and the great flood, etc., etc.); God abhors sin of which we are all guilty; no matter how big or how small (even the little white lie); sin is sin to God, and the penalty for sin is eternal death and separation from God.<br /><br />The Bible also tells of the Mark of the Beast that the coming world leader (the anti-Christ) will force everyone to take (either on their right hand or forehead). If you don't take the mark you will die. The thing about that is that we are all going to die. If you take the mark though, you will be damned eternally to hell and without God.<br /><br />The good news is that God loves us so much that He provided a way for us to be with Him eternally in heaven instead of eternally dead in our sins. For those who choose to believe, repent (turn back to God), receive and follow His command (not request) to accept His only holy blood covering for our sins, Yahushua Ha Mashiach (Jesus the Christ), we will be allowed to join Him in the new heaven and new earth that God says He will replace after all that is destroyed during this tribulation period of utter horrible death and destruction.<br /><br />Whether we believe in God or not, heaven and hell or not, we all believe that we are all going to die, just like we all believe that we need air to breath even if we can't see the air, along with if we jump off a tall building, we will fall cuz of gravity, which we also can't see, etc., etc.<br /><br />The question is, will we die only once with and for God if we repented, received and followed the sin covering that God provided for us through the perfect shed blood sacrifice of His Messiah Yahushua, who beat death and hell when He rose again and thus through His shed blood covering our sins, we will be able to enter into heaven with God forever?<br /><br />Is our choice instead to reject God's Messiah and take the easy way out while we still have to live in this world along with accepting the mark of the Beast from the antiChrist that's coming (or already here) that will lead this war against Israel? God says that we cannot serve two masters; that we have to choose to live and die once for Him or live and die forever without Him. It's just sad that people would rather have the temporary comfort leading to the eternal torment of satan than the temporary trouble leading to the eternal freedom and blessings of God.<br /><br />God's Word, whether we choose to believe is real (like Him) or not (and which has been proven true and continues to do so); I believe is as true as it was yesterday, is today and will be forever (just like Him with His swift terrible justice and His immeasurable love for us all because He provided our eTicket to heaven, the sacrificed and risen Yahushua the Messiah). Will you die with God or without Him? Will you die for Him or against Him? Will you accept the bail (Yahushua HaMashiach) that He paid on your behalf to get out of satan's hell so that you can enter into His heaven?<br /><br />My prayer is that all will ask Jesus Christ (Yeshua or Yahushua the Messiah) into their heart and follow Him so that all may know God's plan for our eternal salvation (rescue from our sins and eternal separation from God in hell) through His perfect sinless sacrificial substitute for our sins, Yahushua, and know His boundless, unconditional love, light, ultimate peace, power, strength, comfort, mercy, grace, beauty, healing, hope, joy and blessings, for you are so very precious in His sight!<br /><br />It's God's way (that He says in His Holy Word is only through His Holy Son Yahushua) or the highway (straight to hell). May God have mercy on us all on our way to finding (or rejecting) and then serving Him!<br /><br />Jesus is my hope in life and my life in death.<br /><br />Please take very good care, shalom and may you find healing and eternal life in the holy name of Jesus Christ!<br /><br />Yahushua loves you!\\n\",\n",

There are 2 packets, the Rendang Curry paste and dried coconut milk powder.  Besides the meat and vegetables, you need to add some water.

The tea bags are a decent size and the tea, even when strong, is nicely mellow  without any bitterness. When it is brewed strong there is a nice tannic base but again, without the bitterness of a (all) black tea.  It has to be the combination of black and orange pekoe teas in Welsh Brew that makes it so.  RR has gone-in the American market, at least--to an all black tea formulation.

Don't leave this world without Him...<br /><br />Gift of God<br /><br />With all the bad going on in the world, God wants us to tell everyone about His good news.<br /><br />It's so fascinating always watching everything unfold just like the Bible predicts. I am often sent emails saying to forward it to everyone on my list if I am not ashamed of Yahweh (God) and His Messiah Yahushua HaMashiach (Jesus Christ). I do not forward those emails cuz I don't trust them (I'm not computer literate either), so I am sending this to everyone on my list (along with everyone else), as God does command us (no matter what the consequence to us) to share His good news with every one of His Messiah providing us with the only good way out of this world.<br /><br />Yep, just like it says it's going to happen in the Holy Bible (no matter which version is chosen to be believed or not believed), it's gonna get beyond tragically ugly here. If we think that there's been bad stuff already happening, we ain't seen nothin yet. Pretty much (if I remember correctly, but it's in the Bible), God unleashes 7 plagues the likes of which the world has never seen nor will see again (remember Sodom and Gomorrah, Noah's Ark and the great flood, etc., etc.); God abhors sin of which we are all guilty; no matter how big or how small (even the little white lie); sin is sin to God, and the penalty for sin is eternal death and separation from God.<br /><br />The Bible also tells of the Mark of the Beast that the coming world leader (the anti-Christ) will force everyone to take (either on their right hand or forehead). If you don't take the mark you will die. The thing about that is that we are all going to die. If you take the mark though, you will be damned eternally to hell and without God.<br /><br />The good news is that God loves us so much that He provided a way for us to be with Him eternally in heaven instead of eternally dead in our sins. For those who choose to believe, repent (turn back to God), receive and follow His command (not request) to accept His only holy blood covering for our sins, Yahushua Ha Mashiach (Jesus the Christ), we will be allowed to join Him in the new heaven and new earth that God says He will replace after all that is destroyed during this tribulation period of utter horrible death and destruction.<br /><br />Whether we believe in God or not, heaven and hell or not, we all believe that we are all going to die, just like we all believe that we need air to breath even if we can't see the air, along with if we jump off a tall building, we will fall cuz of gravity, which we also can't see, etc., etc.<br /><br />The question is, will we die only once with and for God if we repented, received and followed the sin covering that God provided for us through the perfect shed blood sacrifice of His Messiah Yahushua, who beat death and hell when He rose again and thus through His shed blood covering our sins, we will be able to enter into heaven with God forever?<br /><br />Is our choice instead to reject God's Messiah and take the easy way out while we still have to live in this world along with accepting the mark of the Beast from the antiChrist that's coming (or already here) that will lead this war against Israel? God says that we cannot serve two masters; that we have to choose to live and die once for Him or live and die forever without Him. It's just sad that people would rather have the temporary comfort leading to the eternal torment of satan than the temporary trouble leading to the eternal freedom and blessings of God.<br /><br />God's Word, whether we choose to believe is real (like Him) or not (and which has been proven true and continues to do so); I believe is as true as it was yesterday, is today and will be forever (just like Him with His swift terrible justice and His immeasurable love for us all because He provided our eTicket to heaven, the sacrificed and risen Yahushua the Messiah). Will you die with God or without Him? Will you die for Him or against Him? Will you accept the bail (Yahushua HaMashiach) that He paid on your behalf to get out of satan's hell so that you can enter into His heaven?<br /><br />My prayer is that all will ask Jesus Christ (Yeshua or Yahushua the Messiah) into their heart and follow Him so that all may know God's plan for our eternal salvation (rescue from our sins and eternal separation from God in hell) through His perfect sinless sacrificial substitute for our sins, Yahushua, and know His boundless, unconditional love, light, ultimate peace, power, strength, comfort, mercy, grace, beauty, healing, hope, joy and blessings, for you are so very precious in His sight!<br /><br />It's God's way (that He says in His Holy Word is only through His Holy Son Yahushua) or the highway (straight to hell). May God have mercy on us all on our way to finding (or rejecting) and then serving Him!<br /><br />Jesus is my hope in life and my life in death.<br /><br />Please take very good care, shalom and may you find healing and eternal life in the holy name of Jesus Christ!<br /><br />Yahushua loves you!\\n\",\n",
